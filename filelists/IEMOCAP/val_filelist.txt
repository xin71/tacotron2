I don't- I think I'm just going to lose my mind.  So if you could please just not do that, that would be great.  Thank you

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M000.wav|He saw it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F001.wav|How could he see it?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M001.wav|He was out here when it broke
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F002.wav|When
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M002.wav|About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right there when it cracked
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F003.wav|What was he doing out here at four in the morning
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M003.wav|I don't know.  When it cracked, he ran back into the house and cried in the kitchen
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F004.wav|Did you talk to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M004.wav|No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F005.wav|He cried hard
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M005.wav|I could hear him right through the floor of my room
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F006.wav|What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M006.wav|I guess he is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F007.wav|He's getting just like after he died
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F008.wav|What's the meaning in that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M007.wav|I don't know the meaning of this, mom.  But I know one thing you made a terrible mistake with dad
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F009.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M008.wav|Being dishonest with him, that kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F010.wav|What do you mean dishonest
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M009.wav|You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F011.wav|What do you want to do, argue with him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M010.wav|I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M011.wav|Why shouldn't he dream of him?  Walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F012.wav|You can't say that to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M012.wav|We've got to say it to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F013.wav|How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M013.wav|For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F015.wav|The trouble is the goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be Larry

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F016.wav|Why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M016.wav|You know why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F017.wav|Well I got an idea but what's the story
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M017.wav|I'm going to ask her to marry me

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F020.wav|Well you want to make sure that father isn't going to
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M020.wav|Then it isn't just my business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F021.wav|I'm just saying
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M021.wav|Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M022.wav|Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F022.wav|I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F023.wav|From father's point of view, he's not dead and you have no right to take his girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F024.wav|Now you can go on from there and you know where to go, but I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See I don't know.  Now what can I do for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M024.wav|I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life time after time after time

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F026.wav|Did you ask Annie yet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M026.wav|I wanted to get this settled first
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F027.wav|How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M027.wav|Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M028.wav|and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom.  Don't avoid me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F028.wav|The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M030.wav|Because it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F030.wav|Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_F024.wav|How many
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_M029.wav|Just about all

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_M030.wav|It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_M031.wav|For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_M034.wav|And I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was mad
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_M035.wav|a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_M036.wav|And then I came home and it was amazing

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_M038.wav|The whole thing to them was sort of a bus accident. Then I went to work with father and that whole rat race again

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_M040.wav|because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_M043.wav|when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_M044.wav|Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro03/Ses04M_impro03_F024.wav|This is why men don't plan weddings. [LAUGHTER
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro03/Ses04M_impro03_M030.wav|Yeah.  Well maybe--maybe you're right. Maybe there's something to that

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M004.wav|there's just like no jobs available.  I mean, it's just like, God
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M005.wav|Yeah, I tried that.  And there was like, yeah, like I did like one thing once.  But, like, that's not -- it doesn't last very long.  And it's not enough to live on
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_F003.wav|Right, but you have -- I mean, you have to keep on them.  You have to keep calling and reminding them that you're still looking an
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_F004.wav|I mean, you have to be really aggressive about it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M006.wav|Yeah, I do.  I do.  You don't understand

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M008.wav|But, like, it's been years now and I just can't seem to get anything that really fits.  It's just it -- I -- it drives me absolutely insane
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_F005.wav|Well, I mean, if it's that bad, maybe you're gonna have to take something that doesn't really fit, you know.  Like maybe you'll have to do something else for a while.  Find a new field, new skill
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M009.wav|No, no, no, no, no.  I can't- I can't do that.  I can't, I- because if I'm not- if I'm not- if I'm not doing something that I love, then I can't -- I can't- I mean it's- what's the point
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_F006.wav|Well then you're choosing to be unemployed, really
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M010.wav|I'm not choosing. I'm not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_F007.wav|If you're not willing to try and work with it and find something and, you know, I mean, there are things you could do
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M011.wav|No, but I'm try- but like all the things that I-it's like I apply to all these places and none of the
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M012.wav|-- I mean, I don't understand.  It's like -- I mean, I feel like I'm qualified enough.  I just don't understand.  Like, I mean, it's just like a matter of circumstance, but it's been three years, you know, three years
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_F008.wav|Well maybe, you know, your luck it is just down and the market for your particular field is down and maybe you just need to look into doing something else for a while
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M013.wav|This is stupid
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_F009.wav|I mean, I'm not saying that you should, you know-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M014.wav|You know what, this is your fault
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_F010.wav|Excuse me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M015.wav|It's your fault 'cause -cause you always told me to- to do this and I did that instead.  And I didn't take your advice and - and- but you sort of were like were telling-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_F011.wav|It's my fault 'cause you didn't do what I told you to
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M016.wav|Yeah, exactly
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_F012.wav|Well that sounds like your fault
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M017.wav|Yeah
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_F013.wav|You didn't do what I told you to do
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M018.wav|That's 'cause you always tell me to do the wrong thing.  And I thought this time it was -- I was gonna be right by going with the opposite thing. So it's your fault becaus
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M019.wav|-because you were always wrong and-and-and this time you were right. And-and I didn't -- yeah, that's why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_F014.wav|That's amazing logic that you managed to turn that around and make it my fault

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_F015.wav|I think maybe you can't get employed because you aren't willing to take responsibility for your own actions

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_1/Ses04M_script01_1_F020.wav|I'm just saying
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_1/Ses04M_script01_1_M022.wav|Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_1/Ses04M_script01_1_F021.wav|I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_1/Ses04M_script01_1_F033.wav|Just give it some more thought
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_1/Ses04M_script01_1_M033.wav|I've given it three years' of thought.  I'd hope that i

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_1/Ses04M_script01_1_M038.wav|Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F005.wav|Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M010.wav|I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted someplace we'd never been; someplace where we'd be brand new to each other

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F010.wav|I almost got married two years ago
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M013.wav|Why didn't you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F011.wav|You started to write me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M014.wav|You felt something that far back
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F012.wav|Every day since
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M015.wav|Anne, why didn't you let me know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F013.wav|I was waiting for you, Chris.  'Til then, you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  You sure can be ambiguous, you know

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F014.wav|I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M018.wav|Anne, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F015.wav|Not like that you're not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M019.wav|I kissed you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F016.wav|Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it, Chris
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M020.wav|Let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M021.wav|No, no, nothing like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F018.wav|Then what's wrong.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M022.wav|Yes, I suppose there has been.  But it's going from me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F019.wav|You've got to tell me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M023.wav|I don't know where to start
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F020.wav|It wouldn't work this way
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M024.wav|It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F021.wav|Yeah, sure
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M025.wav|Well I lost them
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F022.wav|How many
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M026.wav|Just about all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F023.wav|Oh, gees
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M027.wav|It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M029.wav|They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M030.wav|And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see?  But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M031.wav|a kind of responsibility.  Man for man.  You understand me?  And then I went home and it was incredible
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M033.wav|because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F024.wav|And do you still feel that way
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M036.wav|I want you now, Annie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F025.wav|Because you mustn't feel that way anymore, Chris.  Because you have a right to everything you have, everything, Chris; to me, too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F026.wav|And your money, there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  You should be proud.  A man should be paid for that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M037.wav|Annie, Annie, I'm going to make you a fortune
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F027.wav|What'll I do with a fortune
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M000.wav|What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here; couldn't be better
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M001.wav|Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.  How you doing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F000.wav|Fine
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M003.wav|How you doing?  Oh, no, you know what I did?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should have brought my flashlight
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F001.wav|What flashlight
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M004.wav|The flashlight; the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F002.wav|It's not yours
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M005.wav|Whose is it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F003.wav|It's ours.  It's mine, too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M006.wav|Well, sure
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F004.wav|You kept saying my flashlight as if it's somehow just yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M007.wav|No, of course, our flashlight; yours and mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight, naturally.  How could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M008.wav|I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F005.wav|Yes
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M009.wav|Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M011.wav|I wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F006.wav|I'm cold

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M013.wav|Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F008.wav|There is no point in coming down here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M014.wav|Right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F009.wav|That's my point
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M015.wav|That's my point, too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F010.wav|So let's go home
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M016.wav|No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F011.wav|Not particularly
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M017.wav|Why not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F012.wav|I just don't.  It's stupid
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F013.wav|Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M019.wav|Yeah, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  I mean, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating, something like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M020.wav|There's mystery here and magic

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F015.wav|This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M022.wav|Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M023.wav|There's mystery here and magic; a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you can not be interested

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F018.wav|Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got into a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M026.wav|We weren't in a good spot
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F019.wav|We didn't see them the first time either
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M027.wav|We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there.  What's that?  Is that 
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M030.wav|just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one, they turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M031.wav|They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F020.wav|That's the wind
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M033.wav|Well so what did you think
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F021.wav|About what
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F000.wav|Look at this, goose bumps
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M000.wav|Well so what'd you think
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F001.wav|About what
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M001.wav|What I said
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F002.wav|It's ridiculous
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M002.wav|Certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F003.wav|It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M003.wav|I'm not the only one.  Look at these people
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M004.wav|Are we talking about the same thing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F005.wav|Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M005.wav|Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way, but are you having your period
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F006.wav|Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M006.wav|Well what's bugging you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F007.wav|We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M007.wav|There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F008.wav|For heaven's sake, we are not going to see the grunions
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M008.wav|Why not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F009.wav|We never do, do we?  Have we ever
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M009.wav|We've missed them twice
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M010.wav|That's not ever
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F010.wav|Twice is every time we've tried.  That's ever
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M011.wav|We'll see them this year
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M012.wav|I thought you wanted to see them

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M013.wav|No, of course, not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F013.wav|I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M014.wav|It's just fish; nothing to get traumatized over
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F014.wav|For heaven's sake, this is not about fish

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F015.wav|Do you remember the first time we came to see it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M018.wav|uh, taking the car out of the gara- out of the garage
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M019.wav|Uh
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M020.wav|Wait a minute, I've got it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F018.wav|Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F020.wav|No

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F026.wav|I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to

You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M030.wav|No, I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and wind in our hair and sand in our toes and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M031.wav|And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M032.wav|Yes, it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F028.wav|Oh, right, sure.  This is standing on the beach.   This is waiting.  This is fighting
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M033.wav|Right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F029.wav|But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F030.wav|This is just this.  I mean, it includes a lot and everything, but it's just not, you know, something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M035.wav|I'm doing the best I can
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M036.wav|Maybe if you were with somebody else, too, huh
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F032.wav|I didn't say that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M037.wav|No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F034.wav|Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else; somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M039.wav|Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F035.wav|Okay, fine.  So we're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M040.wav|I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you've got of the moon from here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F036.wav|Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.  I'm sorry, Augie

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M042.wav|Or not

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_F000.wav|Do you think it's them
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_M001.wav|I wonder
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_F001.wav|Nobody knows we're here, except Freda and she wouldn't ring up

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_M003.wav|We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_F003.wav|Now and always sweet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_M004.wav|I don't care, then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_F004.wav|It was bound to come sooner or later
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_M005.wav|Hello, hello.  What?  Wrong number
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_F005.wav|Oh, it sent shivers up my spine
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_M006.wav|What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_F006.wav|Behave exquisitely
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_M007.wav|With the mo- with the most perfect poise
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_F007.wav|Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_M008.wav|Ah.  Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter when one's happy, do they
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_F008.wav|But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_M009.wav|Don't say that, darling
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_F009.wav|It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_M010.wav|Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_F010.wav|Yes, meaning just that

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_F015.wav|Shall we always want to bicker and fight
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_M016.wav|No.  That fire will fade along with our passion
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_F016.wav|Oh, dear.  Should we like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_M017.wav|It all depends on how well we've played
