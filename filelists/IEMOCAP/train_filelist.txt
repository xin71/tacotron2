/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M002.wav|Who told you to get in this line
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F003.wav|You did
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F004.wav|You were standing at the beginning and you directed me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M003.wav|Okay. But I didn't tell you to get in this line if you are filling out this particular form
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F005.wav|Well what's the problem?  Let me change it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M004.wav|This form is a Z.X.four
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M005.wav|You can't--  This is not the line for Z.X.four.  If you're going to fill out the Z.X.four, you need to have a different form of ID
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F006.wav|What?  I'm getting an ID.  This is why I'm here.  My wallet was stolen
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M006.wav|No. I need another set of ID to prove this is actually you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F007.wav|How am I supposed to get an ID without an ID?  How does a person get an ID in the first place
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M007.wav|I don't know.  But I need an ID to pass this form along.  I can't just send it along without an ID
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F008.wav|I'm here to get an ID
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M008.wav|No.  I need another ID, a separate one
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F009.wav|Like what?  Like a birth certificate
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M009.wav|A birth certificate, a passport...a student ID; didn't you go to school?  Anything
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F010.wav|Who the hell has a birth certificate
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F011.wav|Yes but my wallet was stolen, I don't have anything.  I don't have any credit cards, I don't have my ID.  Don't you have things on file here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M010.wav|Yeah.  We keep it on file, but we need an ID to access that file
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F012.wav|That's out of control
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M011.wav|I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here.  It's just a simple form.  I just need an ID
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F013.wav|How long have you been working here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M012.wav|Actually too long
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F014.wav|Clearly.  You know, do you have like a supervisor or something
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M013.wav|Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Huh? Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Fine.  I'll be right back
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F015.wav|That would - I would appreciate that.  Yeah

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_M000.wav|It's not fair
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_F001.wav|Yeah.  I know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_M001.wav|I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_F002.wav|I don't know.  I put in that. request too. They didn't..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_F003.wav|I guess, you know, everybody has to make sacrifices
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_M002.wav|I don't know, it's just not fair.  I think you've already made your sacrifice
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_F004.wav|There's people that have given more though, you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_M003.wav|I just don't see how they can make you leave when you have a new baby - we have a new kid

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_M004.wav|Then why is that fair?  Why-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_F006.wav|There's babies over there, though, that need mothers
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_M005.wav|I don't know how you can be okay with this?  I don't know why you're not-- you're fine with it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_F007.wav|I'm not okay with it, but I don't-- it's not like I have a choice.  I don't see what crying about it is going to fix
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_M006.wav|I'm just trying to think of another way.  I'm just trying to..

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F007.wav|Yeah.  I saw a posting at the theatre

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M011.wav|I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F011.wav|A resume
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M012.wav|Yeah.  Do you have a resume
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F012.wav|No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M013.wav|It's kind of helpful when getting a job
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F013.wav|I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M014.wav|Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F014.wav|Yeah
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F015.wav|I don't like- I don't like sending things in the mail.  I don't want my information out there
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M015.wav|No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F016.wav|I'm there in front of them.  I'm telling them what I'm good at
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M016.wav|Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F017.wav|Why?  It's a piece of paper
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M017.wav|No.  But it has an outline, you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F018.wav|I just don't want this paper trail, you know.  I just don't want things following me around, like-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M018.wav|I know.  Okay.  Well, um. Maybe-

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M019.wav|Yeah
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M020.wav|Okay, yeah.  I would imagine
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F020.wav|..I just-..I just think it's kind of prejudiced and they are really discriminating against people who just aren't that way
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M021.wav|Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M002.wav|Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M004.wav|I guess he is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F006.wav|It's getting to be just like after he died.  What's the meaning of that

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F007.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M006.wav|Being dishonest with him, you know.  This kind of thing always pays off and it's paying off
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F008.wav|What do you mean dishonest
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M007.wav|You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F009.wav|What do you want to do?  Argue with him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M008.wav|I don't want to argue but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M009.wav|You know?  Why shouldn't he walk the nights thinking of him, dreaming of him?   Do we contradict him?  Do we say, we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years now
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F010.wav|You can't say that to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M010.wav|We've got to say it to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F011.wav|Where's the proof?  Do you have any proof
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M011.wav|For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years; that's insane
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F012.wav|To you it is, to me it is, but to your father, you can talk yourself until you are blue in the face.  But there is no grave and there is no body, so where are you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M012.wav|Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F013.wav|It's that the trouble is those God damn newspapers.  Every month some new boy comes back and so the next one is going to be Larry, they just-

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F014.wav|Why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M014.wav|You know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F015.wav|Well I got an idea, but what's your story
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M015.wav|I'm going to ask her to marry me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F016.wav|Well that's only your business, Chris
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M016.wav|You know it's not just my business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F017.wav|Well what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M017.wav|So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F018.wav|Well you want to make sure that your father is not going to -
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M018.wav|Then it's not just my business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F019.wav|I'm just saying
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M019.wav|You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F020.wav|Oh.  I ignore what I got to ignore.  That girl is Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M020.wav|She's not Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F021.wav|From your father's point of view, he is not dead and- Chris he still thinks he's still alive.  The girl is Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F022.wav|Now you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm telling you, I don't know where to go
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M021.wav|I don't know why it is, but every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because I am afraid other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F023.wav|You're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong in that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M022.wav|To hell with that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F024.wav|I just don't see why.  Have you asked Annie yet

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F025.wav|Then what?  Chris.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M023.wav|Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M024.wav|I don't even know how to start
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F027.wav|It wouldn't work like this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M025.wav|It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F028.wav|Yeah, sure
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M026.wav|Well I lost them

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M027.wav|Pretty much all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F030.wav|Aw, geez
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M028.wav|You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F031.wav|Mmhmm
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M034.wav|Driving my new car and seeing a new refrigerator
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M036.wav|And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F032.wav|Do you still feel that way
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M037.wav|I just want you to know Annie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F033.wav|Because you mustn't feel that way.  Everything you have, you've earned - everything.  you understand me

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M000.wav|What time is it?  I think it's supposed to run around midnight, right?  God, this is great, isn't it, Carla?  Look at this night we got here, huh
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M001.wav|Actually I want to get a little further up the coast, get away from all like the lights and the people, but...  How are you doing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_F000.wav|Fine
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M002.wav|Okay.  Is that, is that-

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M012.wav|Naturally.  God, how could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out, though

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M014.wav|Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know, we should have brought the blanket?  Our blanket
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M015.wav|Aw.  Do you know, I should have brought a six pack, too.  A six pack, that would be just the ticket right about now.  Huh
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M016.wav|God, I'm so excited, I'm like a kid.  I can't believe I got out of the house with my fly zipped up

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_1/Ses01F_script03_1_M038.wav|However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_1/Ses01F_script03_1_F031.wav|Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M002.wav|I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F002.wav|Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M003.wav|It was bristling with diamonds.  In the worst possible taste, too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F003.wav|It was not.  I still have it, and I wear it often.  It is very pretty

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F004.wav|I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M005.wav|Well, you let him kiss you, huh?  You said you did
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F005.wav|Well, what of it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M006.wav|What of it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F006.wav|It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M007.wav|What about me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F007.wav|If you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M008.wav|That's a nice point of view, I must say

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M009.wav|So am I.  I'm bored stiff. [GARBAGE]  Do you want some brandy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F009.wav|No.  Thank you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M010.wav|I'll have a little, I think
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F010.wav|I don't know why you'd want any, you've already had three glasses
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M011.wav|No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F011.wav|I just think it's silly to go on and on and on about such a thing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M012.wav|You can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long, going on and on and on
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F012.wav|It's become a habit with you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M013.wav|Oh.  Don't be so grand.  Just because you don't happen to want one at the moment
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F013.wav|Don't be stupid
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M014.wav|Really, Amanda
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F014.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M015.wav|Nothing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M016.wav|you going out somewhere, dear
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F015.wav|No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M017.wav|That reply has broken my heart
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F016.wav|Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M018.wav|Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F017.wav|No it isn't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M019.wav|Yes it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F018.wav|You shut up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M020.wav|Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F019.wav|It's funny it hasn't worked such wonders for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M021.wav|Snap, snap, snap.  You know you are like a little adder
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F020.wav|Adders don't snap, they sting
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M022.wav|Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F021.wav|They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M023.wav|Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F022.wav|Yes I did, quite a lot
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F023.wav|Mind your own business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F024.wav|You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M025.wav|I think I am not in the least bit drunk
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F025.wav|You've always had a weak head
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M026.wav|I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F026.wav|On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F027.wav|Oh shut up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F028.wav|Shut up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F029.wav|Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M028.wav|[LAUGHTER] That's a very good idea.  I think I will
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M029.wav|Look, you better turn that off. I don't want to wake up the people upstairs
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F030.wav|Why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F031.wav|There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M030.wav|Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F032.wav|They are away in Tunis
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M031.wav|This is no time of year for Tunis

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M032.wav|I will do no such thing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F034.wav|Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M033.wav|Will you turn that off, it's driving me mad
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F035.wav|You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M036.wav|Oh.  That's very amusing indeed
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F037.wav|Oh shut up.  Let go.  I hate you, I hate you.  Do you hear?  You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M037.wav|You are a vile, ill-tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I never want to see you again as long as I live
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F038.wav|This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F012.wav|What do you want to do, argue with him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M011.wav|I don't want to argue with him, it's just for God's sake it's time he realized that no one believes with him any more
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F013.wav|You can't say that to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M012.wav|I got to
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F014.wav|What, can you prove it?  What proof do you have?  Can you prove it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M013.wav|For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F015.wav|To you it is, to me it is.  But to your father?  You can talk yourself 'til you're blue in the face but there's was no grave and there is no body.  So where are you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M014.wav|Okay, all right.  Mom, sit down.  I want to talk to you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F016.wav|The trouble is those god damn news papers.  Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M015.wav|Yeah, okay all right, all right.  Listen, um, you know why I asked Annie here, right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F017.wav|Why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M016.wav|You know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F018.wav|Well, I've got an idea but what's the story
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M017.wav|I'm going to ask her to marry me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F019.wav|Well, that's only your business, Chris
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M018.wav|You know it's not just my business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F020.wav|Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough known your own business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M019.wav|So it's okay then?  I'm just going to go ahead with it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F021.wav|You want to make sure that your father's not going to..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F022.wav|I'm just saying
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F023.wav|I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M021.wav|She is not Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M022.wav|I don't know why it is you know every time I reach out for something I have to pull back 'cause I'm afraid it's going to hurt somebody.  All my life..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F025.wav|You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M023.wav|To hell with that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F026.wav|Did you ask Annie yet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M024.wav|No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F027.wav|Well, how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels same way your father does
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M025.wav|Well, if she does then that's the end of it.  However from her letters I think she's pretty much forgotten him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F028.wav|The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M026.wav|So what?  I'm just--I'm not fast with women
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F029.wav|I don't see why it has to be Annie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M027.wav|Because it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F030.wav|That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M028.wav|I don't know, it I think of her, I grew up next to her.  She is what I think of when I think of a wife
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F031.wav|He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F032.wav|Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M029.wav|All right then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F033.wav|Give it some more thought
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M030.wav|I've given it lots of thought.  And I keep coming back to the same thing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F034.wav|What the hell is this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M032.wav|I'll leave.  I'll get married and move somewhere else maybe New York
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F035.wav|Are you crazy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M033.wav|I'll do it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F036.wav|You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M034.wav|Business?  The business doesn't inspire me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F037.wav|Oh, must you be inspired
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M035.wav|Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M036.wav|If that can't happen here..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F038.wav|You mean to tell me you would leave the business for this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M037.wav|Yes, on this I would
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F039.wav|Well, you don't want to think like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M038.wav|Then help me stay here mom
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F040.wav|All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for.  This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M039.wav|I know, I know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M040.wav|Then help me stay
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F041.wav|Well, you don't think like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M041.wav|I am thinking like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F042.wav|I don't understand you, do I
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M042.wav|No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F043.wav|Well, I can see that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_2/Ses01M_script01_2_F000.wav|Why did he invite her here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_2/Ses01M_script01_2_M000.wav|Well, maybe he wanted see her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_2/Ses01M_script01_2_F001.wav|It's been three and a half years.  Why all of a sudden
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_2/Ses01M_script01_2_M001.wav|Well uh, He grew up next door to the girl, why wouldn't he want to see her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_2/Ses01M_script01_2_M002.wav|Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything he told you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_2/Ses01M_script01_2_F002.wav|He's not going to marry her

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_2/Ses01M_script01_2_F005.wav|The girl is not Larry's.  If the girl is Larry's girl she's not his she know she's not

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_2/Ses01M_script01_2_F006.wav|Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men probably a hundred people told her she is crazy but she is waited

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_F018.wav|Well, why didn't the D.M.V. put that you needed your birth certificate on the application then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M018.wav|I--when you're going to the D.M.V., you usually need pretty professional identification-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M019.wav|You know, Official documentation-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_F019.wav|Yeah, but your birth certificate--I mean, who carries around their birth certificate?  Nobody does that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M020.wav|No, but you come--you come to the D.M.V., it's something-- You should've- You should've figured-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_F020.wav|With your driver's license and your passport.  Just like everybody else
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M021.wav|But, without your drive--where-where- what about your identification without your driver's license?  I mean, you need--you needed something before then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_F021.wav|Who--you always use your driver's license.  I mean, you're not coming to the D.M.V. if you're not over sixteen and that's when you get your driver's license so you're never gonna need it anyway
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M022.wav|All right.  Well, um, you know, I'd love to help you, but--nothing I can do
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M023.wav|So, if you wanna go get your birth certificate, um, maybe come back--I don't--maybe you can talk to the person in the--in the front of line maybe.  I don't know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_F022.wav|Do you have a supervisor
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M024.wav|I am the supervisor.  So-

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F000.wav|It's almost time for me to go
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_M000.wav|I can't believe that--now--are you sure this is absolutely necessary?  Like-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F001.wav|There's nothing I can do.  I mean, the government you know-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_M001.wav|What--what're we gonna do here?  I can't--I can't do this by myself.  I-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F002.wav|You're gonna have to.  I mean, you're a great father.  You can do it.  I know you can

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F003.wav|I don't think so
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F005.wav|You could send me pictures
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_M004.wav|It's not going to be the same
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_M005.wav|What if--maybe--what if, uh, we went somewhere over there?  I don't--I don't know--I--I need to figure something out for this because-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F006.wav|Their not gonna let you.  You have to stay home and I have to go.  I mean, that's all-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F007.wav|and--I mean, my daughter--I don't want to put her in danger.  You know?  She has to stay
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_M006.wav|This is gonna be a--a crucial yet--she's--she's growing up.  She's gonna need you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F008.wav|I know, but, she needs to be safe more.  She needs to be around kids her age--own age.  She needs to be able to play on the streets and-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F009.wav|You can just remember it for me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_M008.wav|I don't know--I don't know--I don't know how--I don't know how this could even be possible for you--I--if I was-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F010.wav|Well, I need--I need you to be able to do this for me 'cause I can't do anything about it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F011.wav|I mean, it's just as hard for me, but--I know that we can do it, you kno
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_M009.wav|I mean, you just get to--go off and do your thing.  I mean, yeah, we're both--I don't know--it's bad for both of us, but-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_M010.wav|...it would be so much better if we can--if we could stay together somehow.  You know--we could--we could do this together

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_M014.wav|All right, Sure.  A yeah, that- that'd be good
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_F020.wav|Okay.  Great.  What time of the day would you like
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_M015.wav|Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess.  You know-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_F021.wav|All right.  Great.  Well we have a very open flight that leaves at nine a.m. and fortunately uh the time change actually goes um backwards from that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_F022.wav|So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning.  So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_M016.wav|And, like, there's there's shuttles or something that I can get to the hotel
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_F023.wav|Absolutely.  That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel.  You just give me your address.  We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_F024.wav|And a there will also be a shuttle waiting for you to take you to the appropriate hotel
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_M017.wav|Okay.  Wow.  Sounds good then, I guess.  Thank you very much. It's a lot better than talking to a machine
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_F025.wav|Yeah--I completely understand.  It's a difficult process sometimes and we want to make traveling as easy as possible
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_M018.wav|All right.  So we're confirmed then or do you--All right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_F026.wav|Absolutely. Thank you so much for calling and we hope that you will come to us again
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_M019.wav|Okay
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_F027.wav|Thank you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F000.wav|What's he gonna say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M000.wav|He saw it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F001.wav|How could he see it?  I was the first one up, he was still in bed
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M001.wav|He was out here when it broke
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F002.wav|When
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M002.wav|About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F003.wav|What was he doing out here at four in the morning
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M003.wav|I don't know.  When it cracked, he ran back in the house and cried in the kitchen
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F004.wav|Did you talk to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M004.wav|No.  I thought it was best to leave him alone
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F005.wav|He cried hard
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M005.wav|I could hear him right through the floor of my room
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F006.wav|What was he doing out here at that hour
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F007.wav|He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M006.wav|I guess he is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F008.wav|He's getting just like after he died.  What is the meaning of that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M007.wav|I don't know the meaning of it.  But, I know one thing Mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F009.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M008.wav|Being dishonest with him.  I mean, that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F010.wav|What you mean dishonest
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M009.wav|You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F011.wav|What do you want to do argue with him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M010.wav|No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M011.wav|Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F012.wav|You can't say that to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M012.wav|We've got to say it to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F013.wav|Can you prove it?  How can you prove it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M013.wav|For God sakes, it's been three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F014.wav|To you it is and to me, but not to him.  I mean, you can talk yourself blue in the face, but he--there's no body and no grave so where are you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M014.wav|Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F015.wav|Trouble is the God damn newspapers.  Every month or so a boy turns up out of nowhere so, you know, the next one is gonna be Larry
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M015.wav|All right.  All right.  Listen to me.  You know why I brought Annie here don't you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F016.wav|Why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M016.wav|You know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F017.wav|I've got an idea, but what's the story
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M017.wav|I'm gonna ask her to marry me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F018.wav|Well, that's only your business, Chris
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M018.wav|You know it's not only my business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F019.wav|What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M019.wav|So it's all right then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M020.wav|I'll go ahead with it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F020.wav|Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't going to-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M021.wav|Well, then it isn't just my business-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F021.wav|I'm just saying that-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M022.wav|Ah, sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  I mean, isn't it your business too if I tell Dad and flips--freaks out about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F022.wav|I ignore what I gotta ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M023.wav|She's not Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F023.wav|From your father's point of view, he isn't dead.  And you've no right to take his girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F024.wav|And you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.  Now what can I do for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F025.wav|You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M025.wav|To hell with that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F026.wav|[BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M026.wav|I wanted to get this settled first
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F027.wav|Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F028.wav|Trouble is, you don't see enough women
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F029.wav|You never did
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M028.wav|So what, I'm not fast with women
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F030.wav|I just don't see why it has to be Annie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M029.wav|Because it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F031.wav|Well, that's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.  I mean, you've been away for--at war.  It's been five years
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M030.wav|I can't help it.  I know her best.  I mean, I grew up next door to her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M031.wav|These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F032.wav|I don't want a diagram.  Umm-- He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F033.wav|I mean, what's gonna happen to your father?  Do you know?  I don't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M032.wav|All right.  All right, then, Mom
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F034.wav|I just--give it some more thought
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M033.wav|I've given it three years of thought.  I thought that if I waited Dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M034.wav|But if I can't--if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F035.wav|What the hell is this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M035.wav|I'll get out.  I'll get married and go live some place else.  Maybe New York
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F036.wav|Are you crazy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M036.wav|I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F037.wav|What about the business?  What the hell is this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M037.wav|The business?  The business doesn't inspire me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F038.wav|Must you be inspired
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M038.wav|Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M039.wav|I want a family.  I want kids.  I want something that I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now, where do I find it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F039.wav|Tell me, you'd leave the business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M040.wav|Yes, on this I would
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F040.wav|Well, you don't want to think like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M041.wav|Then help me stay here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F041.wav|All right, but just don't go thinkin' like that 'cause otherwise what did we work for?  I mean, the whole thing is for you, Chris.  The whole shootin' match is for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M042.wav|I know.  I know, Mom.  Just help me stay here

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F044.wav|I can see that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F000.wav|Why did he invite her here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M000.wav|Why does that bother you

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F006.wav|What's going on here, Joe
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M006.wav|Now, listen Kate
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F007.wav|She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M007.wav|You can't read her mind
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F008.wav|Well then why is she still single?  I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy, but she's waited
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M008.wav|How do you know why she's waited
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F009.wav|She knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M009.wav|Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F010.wav|Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe?  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M010.wav|Well, what do you want me to do about it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F011.wav|I want you to act like he's coming back.  Both of you.  Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here.  I won't stand for any nonsense
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M011.wav|But Kate-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F012.wav|Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F013.wav|But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M012.wav|Calm yourself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F014.wav|Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M013.wav|Calm yourself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F015.wav|Last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  I mean, you read it yourself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M014.wav|All right.  All right.  Calm yourself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F016.wav|You, above all, have to believe
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M015.wav|What?- Why- Why me above all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F017.wav|Just--just don't stop believing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M016.wav|What does that mean?  Me above all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M017.wav|Look at you.  Look at you shaking
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F018.wav|I can't help it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M018.wav|What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F000.wav|You're the only one I know who loves his parents
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M000.wav|I know, it went out of style, didn't it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F001.wav|It's all right.  It's a good thing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F002.wav|You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M001.wav|You're not sorry you came
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F003.wav|No, not sorry.  Um, but, I'm- I'm not gonna stay
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M002.wav|Why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F004.wav|Well, for one thing, your mother as much as told me to go
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M003.wav|Oh
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F005.wav|You saw that.  I mean and then, well, you've been kind of, um-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M004.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F006.wav|Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M005.wav|The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But, they take it for granted that we're all set
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F007.wav|I knew they would, your mother anyway
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F008.wav|Well
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F009.wav|from her point of view, why else would I come
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M006.wav|Oh.  Would you want to?  I guess you know, this is why I asked you to come
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F010.wav|I--I guess this is why I came
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M007.wav|Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M008.wav|I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M009.wav|I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M010.wav|You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F011.wav|Oh, Chris, I've been ready for a long, long time
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M011.wav|And he's gone forever.  You're sure
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F012.wav|I almost got married two years ago
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M012.wav|Why didn't you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F013.wav|You started to write me and-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M013.wav|You felt something that far back
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F014.wav|Every day since
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M014.wav|Anne, why didn't you let me know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F015.wav|Well, I was waiting for you.  I mean, till then you never wrote and when you did, I mean, what did you say?  You can sure be ambiguous sometimes
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M015.wav|Give me a kiss, Anne.  Give me a
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M016.wav|oh God, I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long--how long I've been waiting to kiss you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F016.wav|I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M017.wav|Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm gonna make you so happy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F017.wav|Not like that you're not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M018.wav|I kissed you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F018.wav|Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M019.wav|Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F019.wav|No.  What is it, your mother
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M020.wav|No.  Nothing like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F020.wav|Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M021.wav|Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F021.wav|You've gotta tell me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M022.wav|I don't know how to start
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F022.wav|It wouldn't work this way
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M023.wav|It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F023.wav|Yeah, sure
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M024.wav|Well, I lost them
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F024.wav|How many
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M025.wav|Just about all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F025.wav|Oh, gee
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M026.wav|It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M028.wav|They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M030.wav|You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M033.wav|I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M034.wav|Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F026.wav|You still feel that way
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M035.wav|I want you now Annie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F027.wav|'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything that you have.  Do you understand that?  Everything, Chris, and me too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F028.wav|I mean, and your money, there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M036.wav|I know Annie.  Annie, I'm gonna make a fortune for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F029.wav|What'll I do with a fortune
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M000.wav|What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M001.wav|This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M002.wav|I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M003.wav|How you doing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F000.wav|Fine
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M004.wav|Is that--no--is that just foam?  I can't even tell
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M005.wav|Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M006.wav|How you doing?  Aw, you know what I forgot?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F001.wav|What flashlight
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M007.wav|You know, the flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one isn't there

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F004.wav|You kept saying my flashlight, if as if somehow it's just yours.  I mean is that supposed to make me feel
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M010.wav|Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F008.wav|There is no point in coming down here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M019.wav|Right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F009.wav|That's my point
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M020.wav|That's my point too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F010.wav|So, let's go
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M021.wav|No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F011.wav|Not particularly
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M022.wav|Why not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F012.wav|I just don't.  It's stupid
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M023.wav|Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year, you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M024.wav|Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F013.wav|Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, they flop around, and swim away.  And then they die
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M025.wav|Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M026.wav|this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F014.wav|What are you so excited about?  I mean, it's not a moon landing we're talking about here.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M027.wav|Yeah they do
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F015.wav|Ah, Augie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M028.wav|Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M029.wav|There's--there's a bit of the magic--some unexplainable here.  I don't see how you can not be interested
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F016.wav|I'm just not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M030.wav|For real
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F017.wav|Yeah
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M031.wav|I don't get it.  The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M032.wav|And last year, I remember specifically you were so excited to go that you stubbed your toe rushing me out of the house and didn't even notice until we got in the car
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F018.wav|Last year, you will also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got in a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the grunions
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M033.wav|We weren't in a good spot
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F019.wav|We didn't see them the first time either
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M034.wav|We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  Believe me, I've got good instincts for these things
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M035.wav|There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M036.wav|Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M037.wav|Somewhere out there, this huge mass of silver fish swimming this way
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M038.wav|They don't know why, we don't know why.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map, it wasn't a decision, just
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M040.wav|It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M041.wav|They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M042.wav|Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F020.wav|That's the wind
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M043.wav|Well, so what do you think
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F021.wav|About what
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M044.wav|What I was saying
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F022.wav|It's ridiculous
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M000.wav|Well, so what do you think
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F000.wav|About what
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M001.wav|What I was saying
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F001.wav|It's ridiculous
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M002.wav|It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F002.wav|It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is gonna take place on the beach
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M003.wav|Well, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M004.wav|Are we talking about the same thing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F004.wav|Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M005.wav|Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F005.wav|God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M006.wav|Well, what's bugging you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F006.wav|We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M007.wav|There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F007.wav|For heaven sake, we're not going to see the grunions
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M008.wav|Why not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F008.wav|We never do, do we?  I mean, have we ever
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M009.wav|We've missed them twice.  That's not ever
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F009.wav|Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M010.wav|Well, we'll see them this year
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F010.wav|No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M011.wav|I thought you wanted to see it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F012.wav|You don't understand anything I'm saying
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M012.wav|No, of course not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F013.wav|I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M013.wav|It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F014.wav|For heaven sake, this isn't about fish
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M014.wav|All right.  Look, I've been trying to work this backwards, but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M015.wav|I mean, you were-  you were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see.  I took a shower.  You watched the news
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M016.wav|You said, "Hey the grunion are running tonight."  I said, "Great, let's go.  I feel lucky.
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M017.wav|Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F015.wav|Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F016.wav|I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F017.wav|And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F018.wav|And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M018.wav|Wait a minute.  I've got it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F019.wav|Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M019.wav|It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, "let's get some champagne," and I said, "time's a wasting" or something like that, right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M020.wav|Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F020.wav|I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M021.wav|Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F021.wav|No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M022.wav|You want me to go get some champagne

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M023.wav|Take off our shoes
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F023.wav|No. No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M024.wav|Well, what?  You want me to breathe in your ear
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F024.wav|No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M025.wav|You wanna get married again

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M027.wav|A vacation
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F027.wav|No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M028.wav|A new carpet?  A poodle?  Ice cream?  Back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What?  Carla, what the hell do you want
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F028.wav|I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M029.wav|Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M030.wav|No.  You think I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like a used Kleenex?  Or that I'd look at you and think, holy hell, when's the next flight to Alaska
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M032.wav|'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F029.wav|This.  What?  What is this?  This isn't even anything
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M033.wav|Yes, it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F030.wav|Uh, right this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M034.wav|Right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F031.wav|Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M037.wav|Maybe if you were with somebody else too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F035.wav|I didn't say that

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F037.wav|Oh, don't be ridiculous.  I mean, don't you know that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F038.wav|You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M040.wav|Well, now that you mention it.  No, I don't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F039.wav|Okay.  Fine so.  We're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M041.wav|I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F040.wav|Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M042.wav|Well, look what we have here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F041.wav|Augie, you brought refreshments
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M043.wav|It's not champagne
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F042.wav|Well, then we don't need glasses
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M044.wav|You still cold?  Do you wanna go home
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F043.wav|No.  I think you might be right.  Maybe this is the spot after all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F044.wav|Augie, I'm sorry
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M045.wav|Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F045.wav|Or not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M046.wav|Or not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M000.wav|Good God
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F000.wav|Do you think it's them
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M001.wav|I wonder
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F001.wav|Well, nobody know we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M002.wav|Must be them, then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F002.wav|What're we gonna do
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M003.wav|We're all right, darling, aren't we?  Whatever happens
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F003.wav|Now and always, sweet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M004.wav|I don't care then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F004.wav|It was bound to come sooner or later
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M005.wav|Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F005.wav|Ah, it send shivers up my spine
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M006.wav|What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F006.wav|Behave exquisitely
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M007.wav|With the most perfect poise
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F007.wav|Oh, of course.  I shall probably do a court curtsy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M008.wav|Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F008.wav|What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M009.wav|Oh, darling, don't say that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F009.wav|It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M010.wav|Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F010.wav|Yes, meaning just that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M011.wav|Oh, what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F011.wav|Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M012.wav|You mustn't be serious, my dear one.  That's just what they want
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F012.wav|Who's they
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M013.wav|All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M014.wav|Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F013.wav|If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M015.wav|Certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun, alright
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F014.wav|Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M016.wav|Who knows
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F015.wav|Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M017.wav|No, that desire will fade.  Along with our passion
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F016.wav|Oh, dear, shall we like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M018.wav|Depends on how well we've played
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F017.wav|Well, what happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the one that's left still laugh
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M019.wav|Yes.  Yes. With all his might
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F018.wav|That's serious enough, isn't it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M020.wav|No. No, it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F019.wav|Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M021.wav|So is everyone else in the long run
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M023.wav|Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F020.wav|Elliott, worms don't pop
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M024.wav|I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as you love me best
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F021.wav|Oh, thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M025.wav|You remember that awful scene we had in Venice
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F022.wav|Which particular one
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M026.wav|The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F023.wav|Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M027.wav|Ah, horrible thing.  I hated it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F024.wav|Yes, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M028.wav|How long did that row last
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F025.wav|It went in intermittently for days
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M029.wav|The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F026.wav|It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M030.wav|That was a rouser, wasn't it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F027.wav|That was the first time you ever hit me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M031.wav|I didn't hit you very hard
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F028.wav|The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M032.wav|Oh, I'll never forget his face
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F029.wav|It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M033.wav|We were very much younger then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F030.wav|And very much sillier
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M034.wav|As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M000.wav|As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F000.wav|Honey, you knew there was nothing in that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M001.wav|I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F001.wav|Presents?  Just a trivial little broach
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M002.wav|Ah, yes, I remember it well.  Bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F002.wav|No, it wasn't.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M003.wav|You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F003.wav|No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M004.wav|You must admit, he was in love with you, wasn't he
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F004.wav|Just a little perhaps, nothing serious
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M005.wav|You let him kiss you.  You said you did
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F005.wav|Well, what of it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M006.wav|What of it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F006.wav|It didn't hurt him at all and I enjoyed it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M007.wav|Well, what about me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F007.wav|Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M008.wav|Well, that's a nice point of view I must say
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F008.wav|I'm bored with this conversation
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M009.wav|Me, too.  Bored stiff.  You want some brandy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F009.wav|No, thanks
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M010.wav|I think I'll have some
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F010.wav|Don't see why you want any.  You've already had two glasses
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M011.wav|No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F011.wav|Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M012.wav|You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F012.wav|Well, it's become a habit with you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M013.wav|You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F013.wav|Don't be so stupid
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M014.wav|Really, Amanda
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F014.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M015.wav|Nothing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M016.wav|Going out somewhere dear
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F015.wav|No, just making myself fascinating for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M017.wav|That reply has broken my heart
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F016.wav|A woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M018.wav|As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F017.wav|No, it isn't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M019.wav|Yes, it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F018.wav|Oh, be quiet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M020.wav|Ah, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro02/Ses02M_impro02_F011.wav|It doesn't make any sense; I don't know why we have to be at war in the first place
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro02/Ses02M_impro02_M012.wav|I know, but it's not our decision, I guess, you know, I mea

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_M017.wav|Yea, that way she was guaranteed that she could not say no
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_F015.wav|Right exactly because you can't say no in front of thousands of people. [LAUGHTER
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_M018.wav|No, but it was good

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_M023.wav|I don't know either do a honeymoon like in the snow or fly down to like Australia, Southern Hemisphere, [GARBAGE] so we'll decide with that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_F020.wav|Ooh, that would be fun
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_F021.wav|Do you think you'll get a house or something, like you guys are looking to buy some place o
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_M024.wav|Yea, yea, I'm not too sure where yet I guess you know, I kind of got to figure some stuff out here firs
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_F022.wav|Yeah. [LAUGHTER
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_M025.wav|but like you know it's just - I guess we're just excited right now that we'll get to continue it together
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_F023.wav|Oh my Gosh. I cannot believe you're getting married, that is so cool

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_M027.wav|Oh, it will, obviously you know. But I know it's something - I don't know, you never really think about it happening, like before hand

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M000.wav|Uhm, I don't kno
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F000.wav|So how you feeling
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M001.wav|I don't know what I'm going to do about this; I mea
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M002.wav|I have got to get a job, you know? Like
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F001.wav|You've been doing a lot of work for it, right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M003.wav|Well, yea you know, I get my resumes and I mean I
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F002.wav|Right, so the fact you doing the best that you can is 
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M004.wav|I go out all the places I can, every place that'll give an interview you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F003.wav|you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M005.wav|But it's been so long, like what - what am I - what am I waiting -- I should probably just do something else, o
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F004.wav|Well, but you care about what you do, right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M006.wav|I don't know, I mean why - wh
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F005.wav|I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and u
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M008.wav|Well, and that's what I begin to question after a while is maybe I just don't want it, maybe it's not even worth it, you know, lik
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M009.wav|I don't even know if it's going to be worth it because I can't break myself in, you know like I can't - can't even get a foot in the door you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F006.wav|Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M010.wav|Yea, it says I'm stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F007.wav|You are persistence. I mean that's important. that'
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M011.wav|I mean, I can't- I can't be persistent forever, you know, you can't not have a job forever, you know, I've got- I've got to do something, I've got to make money and get food on the table
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F008.wav|Well, you're talented so keep that in mind, you know, you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M012.wav|I mean, maybe I'm not, you know. I don't have a job. Maybe - maybe I'm not as good as-as I thought I was an
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M013.wav|I just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out an
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F009.wav|I'm sorry
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M014.wav|I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinkin
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M015.wav|maybe - maybe take up painting, I don't know, you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M016.wav|Do something that I don't have to go out and do something, stay at home, I don't know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M017.wav|Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F010.wav|That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean lik
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F011.wav|and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F012.wav|So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M018.wav|I know, but I mean- if that's the - you know, I'm either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet I mean this doesn'
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F013.wav|It might be the latter I don't know because you're not the worst, I mean you're great, you very talented at what you do
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M019.wav|this doesn't happen to a normal person
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F014.wav|You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F015.wav|But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M020.wav|I mean, I don't know, I don't see - I don't see any other way - any other way around it right now
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F016.wav|Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M021.wav|What am I going to do on a break
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F017.wav|Get out of town or something, I mean you need - you need to clear your head 'cause you seem like you're really frustrated about it. I mean you need to like, be excited about you're doing, rather than, you know upset
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M022.wav|Right. Thanks for talking to me

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F005.wav|Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this tha
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F006.wav|Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_1/Ses02M_script01_1_M034.wav|I've given it three years of thought. I thought that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_3/Ses02M_script01_3_M024.wav|It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in charge of a company

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_1/Ses02M_script02_1_M025.wav|Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_1/Ses02M_script02_1_M028.wav|Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the Lemmings throwing themselves off the cliff

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_M029.wav|I imagine, as I may have already mentioned, I've had three minute liquor glasses of Brandy the whole evening long a child of two couldn't get drunk on that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_F027.wav|On the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of Brandy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_M030.wav|Oh very interesting. How about a child of four, a child of six or a child of nine

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_F030.wav|Why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_M034.wav|Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_M021.wav|About three million dollars

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_M023.wav|-to make up the three million dollars
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_F024.wav|Well, ten hours worth of minutes-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_F025.wav|is what's going to happen
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_M024.wav|Ten hours? So, basically, a day's worth of minutes which I pay forty dollars a month from it

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_F028.wav|and we will take care of it if anything happens.  But all we can do now is ask for your patience
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_F029.wav|Okay? Thank you for calling.  Goodbye
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F000.wav|What's he going to say? Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M000.wav|He saw it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F001.wav|What-how did he see it? I mean, I was the first one up. He was still in bed
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M001.wav|He was out there when it happened
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F002.wav|When
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M002.wav|Um, about four this morning. Uh- I heard a crack and I looked out and I saw him standing there
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F003.wav|What was he doing out at four in the morning
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M003.wav|I don't know. But after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F004.wav|Did you talk to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M004.wav|No, I uh-, I figured the best thing to do was to leave him alone
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F005.wav|He cried hard, huh
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M005.wav|I could hear it right through the floor
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F006.wav|What was he doing out there at that time? He was dreaming about him again. He's walking around at night again
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M006.wav|I guess he is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F007.wav|Could he-he's acting just like he did after he died, you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F008.wav|What's the meaning in that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M007.wav|I don't know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M008.wav|But I know one thing, mom. We've made a terrible mistake with dad
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F009.wav|Well, what do you mean? What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M009.wav|Being dishonest with him. That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F010.wav|What do you mean, dishonest
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M010.wav|You know Larry's not coming back and I know that too. Why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F011.wav|What, you're going to argue with him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M011.wav|No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time that he realized that no one believes that Larry's coming back anymore
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F012.wav|You can't tell him that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M012.wav|We got to tell him that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F013.wav|We can't. It just won't work
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M013.wav|You know, for God's sakes it's been three years. No one comes back after three years. It's insane
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F014.wav|They do come back
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F015.wav|I know, but he doesn't know that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F016.wav|Three years has been a long time
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M014.wav|All right. Just- Sit down, mom. I want to talk to you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F017.wav|It's those Goddamn newspapers, you know? I mean, it's like every day they come out with this new person that comes along. And the next one's going to be Larry
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M015.wav|All right. All right. Just come on, sit down
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F018.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M016.wav|You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F019.wav|Why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M017.wav|You know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F020.wav|Well, I have an idea, but go on, tell me, what's the story
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M018.wav|I want to ask her to marry me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F021.wav|Well, that's only your business, Chris
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M019.wav|Come on, you know that's not only my business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F022.wav|Well, it is. I mean, what do you want me to do? You're grown up; you know what's going on in your mind
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M020.wav|So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F023.wav|Well, you better make sure your father's not- No- I'm just saying
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M021.wav|See, then it's not just my business. God, you hav
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M022.wav|-Oh, you infuriate me sometimes. You know, it's not just my business too if dad throws a fit
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M023.wav|God. You have such a talent for ignoring things
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F024.wav|Yeah, well I ignore what I got to ignore
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F025.wav|And she-she's Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M024.wav|No, she is not Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F026.wav|Well, from your father's point of view she is. I mean, he's still alive. You've got no right to take her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F027.wav|If you go on from that point, I don't know where you go
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F028.wav|'Cause listen, I'm telling you, I don't know where to go from there. Do you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M025.wav|Oh, I don't know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F029.wav|What do you want from me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M026.wav|Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F030.wav|You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M027.wav|To hell with that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F031.wav|There's nothing wrong with it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M028.wav|I didn't ask Annie yet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F032.wav|You didn't ask her yet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M029.wav|I wanted to get this settled first
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F033.wav|Well, how do you know she's going to marry you? I mean, what if she feels the same way as your father
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M030.wav|Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M031.wav|I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad, right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M032.wav|Mom, don't avoid me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F034.wav|You know, the trouble is you've never had enough women. No, you never did
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M033.wav|So what? I'm not fast with women
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F035.wav|I don't understand why it has to be her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M034.wav|Because it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F036.wav|That's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M035.wav|I just
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F037.wav|I mean, you haven't seen her since the war. I mean, it's been five years
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M036.wav|It just is. I
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M037.wav|I grew up with her. Okay. All these years, when I think of someone I want to be my wife I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F038.wav|No, I don't want a diagram
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F039.wav|He thinks he's coming back. You go-go on and marry her, I mean, you're pronouncing her dead. And what's going to happen to your father, huh? I don't know. Do you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M038.wav|Okay. All right, then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F040.wav|Just, listen. Give it more thought, is all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M039.wav|No, I've given it three years of thought
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M040.wav|And I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M041.wav|But if I can't have that here then I'll get out
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F041.wav|What the hell is this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M042.wav|I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F042.wav|You're crazy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M043.wav|I've been a sucker too long. I'm through with it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F043.wav|You're what-you're going to leave the business? But you can't do that. What the hell is this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M044.wav|The business. The business doesn't inspire me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F044.wav|Oh, you have to be inspired
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M046.wav|Now, Annie's in the middle of all that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M047.wav|Now, where do I find it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F045.wav|Tell me something
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F046.wav|You'd leave that business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M048.wav|Yes. On this I would
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F047.wav|You can't do that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M049.wav|Then help me stay here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F048.wav|All right, but you can't do that. You can't talk like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M050.wav|Okay. Just

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M053.wav|No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F053.wav|Yeah. I can see that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F000.wav|Why did you invite her here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M000.wav|Why? Does that bother you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F001.wav|She's been in New York for three-and-a-half years. She don't just suddenly come and
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M001.wav|Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F002.wav|You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M002.wav|What do you mean? They lived next door to each other their entire lives. Why shouldn't he want to see her? Hey, don't look at me like that. I don't know anymore than you do
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F003.wav|He's not going to marry her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M003.wav|How do you know he's even thinking about it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F004.wav|It's got that about it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M004.wav|Well, so what
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F005.wav|What's going on here, Joe
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M005.wav|Listen, kid
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F006.wav|She's not Larry's girl. She knows that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M006.wav|You can't read her mind
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F007.wav|Then why is she married? Then why isn't she married? She's been in New York and there's hundreds of single men there
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F008.wav|I'm sure hundreds of them asked her and told her that she's foolish, but no
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F009.wav|She's waited
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M007.wav|How do you know why she's waited
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F010.wav|Because she thinks like me, that's why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F011.wav|She's faithful as a rock, don't you know. In my worst moments I can think of her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F012.wav|I think again, that I'm-I'm right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M008.wav|Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F013.wav|Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers, but not his father, not his brother
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M009.wav|Calm yourself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F014.wav|Because he's not coming back. Then what do I got to live for? I'll kill myself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M010.wav|Calm yourself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F015.wav|Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F016.wav|Look at it. Because why, when she came here and she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Look at it, look at it, Joe
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M011.wav|All right. All right. Calm yourself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F017.wav|You got to believe, believe with me because I can't stand all alone
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M012.wav|Okay. Just calm yourself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F018.wav|No, you've got to believe
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F019.wav|Believe, Joe. You above all people have got to believe
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M013.wav|Why me, above all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M014.wav|Huh
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M015.wav|Why me above all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F020.wav|You got to keep believing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M016.wav|Look at you, you're shaking
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F021.wav|I can't help it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M017.wav|What have I got to hide
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M018.wav|Huh? What the hell's the matter with you, Kate
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F000.wav|You're the only one I know that still loves his parents
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M000.wav|Yeah. I know. It went out of style, didn't it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F001.wav|No, it's all right. There's nothing wrong in that, you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F002.wav|It's really lovely here. The air is sweet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M001.wav|You're not sorry you came
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F003.wav|No. I'm not sorry. It's
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F004.wav|I can't stay
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M002.wav|Why not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F005.wav|Well, for one thing, your mother so much has told me to go. [LAUGHTER]
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M003.wav|Well
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F006.wav|Look
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F007.wav|you've been acting kind of, well, you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M004.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F008.wav|Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M005.wav|Yes, I guess I have been. But it's going from me now
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F009.wav|Yeah
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M007.wav|How did you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F010.wav|Yeah, they would. Especially your mom
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M008.wav|Well, uh- would you want to
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M009.wav|I, I guess that's why I asked you to come
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F011.wav|Well, I mean
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M010.wav|Oh, Annie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F012.wav|from her opinion, why else would I come here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M011.wav|Annie, I love you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M012.wav|I love you a great deal
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M013.wav|I-I love you. I have no imagination. That's all I know how to tell it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F013.wav|Well, I guess that's why I came
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M015.wav|I don't want to win you from anybody. I want you to be ready for me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F014.wav|I've been ready for a long, long time
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M016.wav|Then he's gone forever. You're sure
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F015.wav|Loo
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F016.wav|I was almost married two years ago
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M017.wav|Why didn't you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F017.wav|'Cause you started to write me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M018.wav|You felt something that far back
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F018.wav|Every day since
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M019.wav|Why didn't you let me know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F019.wav|Well, I don't know, you didn't write until then and then when you did, what'd you say
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F020.wav|You always can be so ambiguous
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M020.wav|Give me a kiss, Annie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M021.wav|Give me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F021.wav|I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M023.wav|We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F022.wav|Not like that, you're not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M024.wav|I kissed you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F023.wav|Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F024.wav|What is it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M025.wav|Let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F025.wav|No. What is it? Is it your mother
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M026.wav|No, no, no, no. Nothing like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F026.wav|Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M027.wav|Yeah. I guess there is. I guess I was, but uh- it's going from me now
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F027.wav|You should tell me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M028.wav|I don't know where to start
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F028.wav|But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M029.wav|You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F029.wav|Yeah, sure
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M030.wav|Well, I lost them
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F030.wav|How many
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M031.wav|Just about all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F031.wav|Geez
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M032.wav|It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M033.wav|For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M035.wav|And I, and I thought something watching them go down
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M037.wav|And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M038.wav|And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M041.wav|Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M042.wav|And I didn't want to take any of it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M043.wav|And I guess that included you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F032.wav|And you still feel that way
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M044.wav|I want you now, Annie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F033.wav|Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F034.wav|I mean, there's nothing wrong in that money, and your father put good planes up in the air and you should be proud of that. A man should be paid for that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M045.wav|Annie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M046.wav|Annie, I'm going to make a fortune for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F035.wav|What am I going to do with a fortune
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M000.wav|Hey, what time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight, right? God, this is great, isn't it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M001.wav|Look at the night we got; couldn't be better

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F009.wav|Well, so let's go
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M021.wav|No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F010.wav|Not particularly
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M023.wav|Why not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F011.wav|I don't know. I just don't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F012.wav|Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M025.wav|Yeah. But that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. And all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you-spawning or mating or something like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M026.wav|I mean, this is the big night for these guys. Life's last orgy

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M027.wav|Yeah, they do
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F014.wav|Oh, God, Augie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M028.wav|What, okay, then it's fish that do something no other fish do. Like the swallows in Capistrano or the lemmings who throw themselves off the cliffs
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M029.wav|There's magic here and mystery and a little bit of the unexplainable. I mean, I don't see how you cannot be interested

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M030.wav|For real
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F016.wav|Yes
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M031.wav|I don't get it. The last time-the first time that we came to see it you said it was the best night of your life
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M032.wav|And then last year when we came to see it you ran out of the house so fast that you stubbed your toe. And you didn't even notice until you got in the car
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F017.wav|Yes, and if you also remember, I got sand in my panties. We got into an argument about nothing. You got a sore throat and we never saw the grunions
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M033.wav|We weren't in a good spot
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F018.wav|No, for God's sakes, we've never seen the grunions. We're not going to see them
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M034.wav|We just weren't in a good spot, all right? This is a much better spot. I have a good instinct for these things. Look, is that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M035.wav|no, that's just seaweed, isn't it? This is great, isn't it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M036.wav|I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M038.wav|And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M040.wav|its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M043.wav|So what do you think
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F020.wav|About what
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M044.wav|About what I just said
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F021.wav|It's ridiculous
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M000.wav|So what do you think
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F000.wav|About what
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M001.wav|About what I was just saying
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F001.wav|It's ridiculous
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M002.wav|It certainly is not. It is slightly exaggerated scientific fact
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F002.wav|It's so P.R. I mean, somebody's giving you a good bill about this wonderful event that's going to happen on the beach

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F003.wav|Exactly. Everyone else is told the same thing. It keeps them feeling excited. Keeps them coming back. Keeps them thinking life's going to start at any minute now
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M004.wav|Are we talking about the same thing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F004.wav|I don't care. It's still fish to me

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F011.wav|It's impossible. It's like waiting around. Waiting to see Santa Claus, you know

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F014.wav|Look, I did. I always do. But it's like every time I try nothing ever happens
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M012.wav|It's just fish. Nothing to get traumatized over

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M013.wav|I've been turning this thing over in my head trying to figure out when the point was when we took a turn for the worse, and I can't seem to pinpoint it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M015.wav|And so I'm getting the animals, putting the animals out in the yard. I'm putting on my jacket, getting the car out of the garage

Do you think I had some great fantasy down the line? That four years down the line that we'd come to the beach and argue with each other over fish

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F035.wav|No, it's not. It's standing on the beach waiting and fighting
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M032.wav|Right

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F043.wav|Well, I guess we're just in the wrong spart-spot with the right person
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M039.wav|Seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view of the moon we've got from here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F044.wav|I noticed that. It's beautiful

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F047.wav|You brought refreshments
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M041.wav|It's not champagne
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F048.wav|At least we won't need glasses

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F049.wav|So I was thinking you might be right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F050.wav|Maybe this is the right place after all

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_F002.wav|I mean, nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_F013.wav|Shall we always want to bicker and fight
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_M015.wav|No. The fire will fade along with our passion

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_M018.wav|No. No, it isn't. Death's very laughable. A cunning little mystery. All done with mirrors

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_F019.wav|Thank you, dear. The same applies to you. Except that if I ever so much as catch you looking at another woman I'll kill you

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_F022.wav|I know you did. You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal. I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M001.wav|I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M004.wav|You must admit that he was in love with you

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M012.wav|No particular reason. Anyhow, they were very small ones
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F012.wav|I don't see what's the point of going on and on about something like this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M013.wav|Oh, my-you can hardly call three minute liquor glasses in the evening going on and on and on
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F013.wav|It's become a habit with you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M014.wav|You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F014.wav|Don't be so stupid
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M015.wav|Really, Amanda
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F015.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M016.wav|Nothing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M017.wav|Going somewhere, dear
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F016.wav|No. Just making myself fascinating for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M018.wav|That reply has broken my heart
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F017.wav|It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M019.wav|As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F018.wav|No, it isn't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M020.wav|Yes, it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F019.wav|No, it's not. I don't care
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M021.wav|It's a pity you didn't have more brandy. It might have made you a little less disagreeable
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F020.wav|Well, it didn't seem to do such wonders with you, now did it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M022.wav|Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F021.wav|Adders don't snap, they sting
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M023.wav|Yes, they do. They have a big bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F022.wav|They sting
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M024.wav|They snap
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F023.wav|I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M025.wav|Uhh
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M026.wav|did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F024.wav|Yes, I did, quite a lot actually
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M027.wav|I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then, didn't you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F025.wav|Mind your business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M028.wav|You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F026.wav|You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M029.wav|I'm not in the least bit drunk
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F027.wav|You've always had a weak head
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M030.wav|Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F028.wav|On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M031.wav|Oh, very interesting indeed. How about a child of four or a child of six or a child of nine. We might have a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F029.wav|Do shut up. Shut up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F030.wav|I don't want to talk about this anymore

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F031.wav|Why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M033.wav|It's very late and it will annoy the people upstairs
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F032.wav|There aren't any people upstairs. It's a photographer's studio
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M034.wav|Well, I suppose the people downstairs then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F033.wav|They're away in Tunis

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F035.wav|Turn it on
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M037.wav|No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F036.wav|You've always had far too temperamental for yourself. You should try to control it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M038.wav|Turn it off

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M021.wav|Okay.  So then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F021.wav|Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M022.wav|Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes.  Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit?  Huh?  God you have such a talent for ignoring things
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F022.wav|Well I'm just saying-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F023.wav|You know I ignore what I got to ignore
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F024.wav|She's not...she's Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M023.wav|She's not Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F025.wav|From your father's point of view he is still alive and if you try and take her that's just not fair.  You can't do that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M024.wav|I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want I have to pull bac
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F026.wav|And-And-And if you go on from there if you know already to go on from there, then you can.  But I'm telling you something that I don't know where to go.  You got it?  I mean, do you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M025.wav|Because other people will suffer
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M026.wav|My whole entire, bloody life time and time again
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F027.wav|You're a considerate fellow.  There is nothing wrong in that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M027.wav|Well to hell with that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F028.wav|Did you ask Annie yet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M028.wav|I wanted to get this settled first
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F029.wav|And what if she doesn't marry you huh?  What if she feels the same way your father does
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M029.wav|Then I guess that's the end of it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M030.wav|But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M031.wav|And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F030.wav|Look, you never had seen many, many women.  You know?  I mean..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M032.wav|Well so what?  I'm just not fast with women
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F031.wav|Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M033.wav|Because it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F032.wav|Well that's a good answer but, it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you left to go to the war and it's been five years
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F033.wav|No I don't want a diagram
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M035.wav|Alright then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F035.wav|Look, just give it some thought okay
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M036.wav|I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M037.wav|But if I can't have that here I'll get out
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F036.wav|What the hell is this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M038.wav|I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F037.wav|Are you crazy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M039.wav|I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F038.wav|You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M040.wav|The business doesn't inspire me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F039.wav|Oh, you have to be inspired
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M042.wav|Now Annie is in the middle of all that.  Where do I find it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F040.wav|Tell me something.  You can leave this business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M043.wav|Yes.  On this I would
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F041.wav|You can't talk like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M044.wav|Then help me stay here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F042.wav|Alright but you can't talk like that you hear
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F043.wav|I mean what the hell have we worked for then?  I mean, it's all for you Chris.  The whole shooting match is for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M045.wav|I know.  Just you help me stay here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F044.wav|Alright but you don't talk like that you hear?  You don't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M046.wav|I am thinking like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F045.wav|I don't understand you do I
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M047.wav|No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F046.wav|Yeah.  I can see that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F000.wav|Why did he invite her here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M000.wav|Why does that bother you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F001.wav|Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M001.wav|Well maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F002.wav|Nobody travels seven hundred miles just see
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M002.wav|uh-uh What do you mean?  They grew up next to each other their entire lives.  Why shouldn't he want to see her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M003.wav|Hey don't look at me like that.  I don't know anymore than you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F003.wav|He's not going to marry her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M004.wav|Who said he even thought about that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F004.wav|I see it.  It has the appearance of it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M005.wav|Well, so what
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F005.wav|What's going on here Joe
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M006.wav|Now listen kid..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F006.wav|No.  She's not his girl Joe and she knows that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M007.wav|You can't read her mind
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M008.wav|How do you know why she's waited?  Hmmm
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F008.wav|Because she knows what I know, that's why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F009.wav|I mean, her faith is stronger than a rock
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F010.wav|My worst times I think about her, you know, and 
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F011.wav|it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M009.wav|Look at how nice the day is.  What are we arguing for
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F012.wav|No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M010.wav|What do you want me to do?  What do you want
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F013.wav|I want-I want you to act like he's still alive.  I mean don't think I haven't seen the way that you've been since he invited her here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M011.wav|But Kate..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F014.wav|But I won't have any of this nonsense because you know what happens?  If he doesn't come back I'll kill myself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M012.wav|Okay. Calm yourself. Just calm yourself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F016.wav|I can't do it all alone
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M013.wav|Calm yourself, alright
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F017.wav|Look, it was just last week that Detroit, some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry, you can read it for yourself. You above all people have got to believe
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M014.wav|Alright, alright, calm yourself okay?  Calm yourself. Wait, wait.  What do you mean, me above all

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M016.wav|Look at you, you're shaking
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F019.wav|I can't help it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M017.wav|What do I got to hide?  Huh?  What the hell's the matter with you Kate
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F000.wav|You're the only one I know that still loves his parents
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M000.wav|I know.  It sort of went out of style didn't it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F001.wav|No.  It's alright.  It's a good thing, you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F002.wav|It's lovely here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F003.wav|The air is so sweet

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M002.wav|Why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F005.wav|First of all your mother so much as told me to go
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M003.wav|Well..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F006.wav|Look
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F007.wav|you saw the way that she acted and then well, I mean, you, you were acting kind of..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M004.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F008.wav|Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M005.wav|Well the trouble is I was planning on sneaking up on you over a week or so and they take it for granted that we're all set
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F009.wav|Yeah.  I know they would, especially your mother
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M006.wav|How did you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F010.wav|Well what other reason, from her point of view, would I be coming here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M007.wav|So, would you want to
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M008.wav|I mean, that's the reason why I asked you here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F011.wav|Well

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F012.wav|I guess that's why I came
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M011.wav|I don't...I have no imagination that's the only way I know how to tell it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M012.wav|I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell you this here.  I wanted to drive someplace brand new where we'd be brand new to each other.  It feels wrong here don't you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M013.wav|This yard and this chair.  I don't want to win you from anything, I want you to be ready for me

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M014.wav|Then he's gone forever, you sure
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F014.wav|Look, I almost got married two years ago
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M015.wav|Why didn't you

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M016.wav|You felt something that far back
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F016.wav|Every day since
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M017.wav|Why didn't you let me know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F017.wav|I was waiting for you Chris, I mean, till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F018.wav|You'd always be so ambiguous

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F025.wav|Tell me what's wrong.  I mean, even in your letters you seemed ashamed
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M025.wav|Well, yes I guess I've been ashamed but, it's going from me

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M026.wav|I don't know where to start
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F027.wav|Okay.  It wouldn't work like this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M027.wav|You remember overseas I was in command of a company

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M028.wav|Well I lost them
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F029.wav|How many
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M029.wav|Just about all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F030.wav|Geez
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M030.wav|Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M031.wav|For instance, one time this...it had been raining several days and this one kid, he came up to me, he gave me his last pair of dry socks, put them in my pocket
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M032.wav|That's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys I had.  They didn't just die, they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M033.wav|A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M034.wav|It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M035.wav|And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M037.wav|And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M038.wav|It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive.  I felt wrong to have that new checkbook
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M039.wav|open that new bank account, drive the new car and see the new refrigerato
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M041.wav|Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M042.wav|And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F032.wav|Cause you must not feel that way again.  You hear me?  You can't.  You deserve everything you have Chris

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F004.wav|Look, I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M005.wav|I thought you wanted to see it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F005.wav|It's just..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F006.wav|Look, we just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to be like
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F007.wav|For heavens sake, grow up.  We're not going to see the Grunions
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M007.wav|Why not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F008.wav|We never do, do we?  Have we ever
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M008.wav|Oh my gosh.  We missed them twice, that's hardly ever
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F009.wav|Okay.  Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M009.wav|Carla, can I ask you something
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F010.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M010.wav|Don't take this wrong but, are you having your period
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F011.wav|Augie, god dammit, don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M011.wav|What's bugging you then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F012.wav|Look, it's pointless.  It's...we're not going to see the Grunions I mean, it's like waiting around to see Santa Claus, you know, it's..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F013.wav|Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M012.wav|I thought you wanted to see it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F014.wav|God, you don't understand anything
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M013.wav|No, of course not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F015.wav|I do.  I always do.  I keep thinking, this time will be the time and it never is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M014.wav|Well, we're going to see it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F016.wav|No we won't.  I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M015.wav|What...I've been trying to, I've been trying to figure out the point where we went wrong and I can't seem to pinpoint that moment
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M016.wav|You were fine during the phone call with Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M017.wav|Let's see I took a shower, you were watching the news, you said hey, hey the Grunions are running tonight and I said great let's go, I feel lucky tonight
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M018.wav|And then I'm putting the animals out in the yard, I'm pulling the car out of the garage, putting my jacket on
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F017.wav|Look, do you remember the first time we came here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F018.wav|We thought I was pregnant
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F019.wav|We brought a bottle of champagne and we took off our shoes and danced barefoot in the sand..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F020.wav|Under the moon and you whispered so softly into my ear so I could feel your words
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F021.wav|And I thought, this is it.  This is how happy I'm supposed to be
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M019.wav|Wait a minute.  I've got it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F022.wav|What?  Dancing barefoot in the sand?  Drinking out of a bottle of champagne
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M020.wav|It was in the car right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M021.wav|And you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M022.wav|You want this to be like the other time right?  That's it right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F023.wav|I'd rather not remember something..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F024.wav|Rather not hope for something
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M023.wav|Okay, right.  I got it.  Sure.  Of course.  Listen, do you want to dance
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F025.wav|No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M024.wav|Do you want me to get some champagne
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F026.wav|No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M025.wav|Take off our shoes
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F027.wav|No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M026.wav|What?  Do you want me to breathe in your ear
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F028.wav|No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F029.wav|No...No...No..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F030.wav|No..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F031.wav|I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M028.wav|Welcome to the human race
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M029.wav|Do you think that this is what I had in mind?  That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?  No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M031.wav|...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F032.wav|This what...what's this?  This isn't anything. Alright.  Sure.  Standing on the beach, fighting and waiting
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M032.wav|Yes it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M033.wav|Right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F033.wav|Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M034.wav|No.  I know.  Me neither
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F034.wav|This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M035.wav|I'm trying to do the best I can
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F035.wav|I know you are Augie.  I know you wanted this evening to be nice
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F036.wav|I can't help thinking about being somewhere else
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M036.wav|Maybe if you were with someone else too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F037.wav|I didn't say that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M037.wav|I know.  But I know I don't make you happy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F038.wav|Augie, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing with you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M038.wav|Yeah
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F039.wav|Yeah.  Don't you know that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F040.wav|If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you.  Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M039.wav|Actually, now that you mention it, no I don't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F041.wav|Well, I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M040.wav|It seemed like a good spot to me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M041.wav|I mean look at the view of the moon we got from here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F042.wav|Yeah.  I noticed that.  It's real pretty on the water
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F043.wav|Big old white moon
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M042.wav|Hey, look what we got here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F044.wav|Oh you brought refreshments
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M043.wav|It's not champagne
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F045.wav|Well at least we won't need glasses
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M044.wav|Are you still cold?  Do you want to go home
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F046.wav|No I'm beginning to think you might be right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F047.wav|I think this may be the place for us after all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F048.wav|I am sorry Augie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M045.wav|Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F049.wav|Or not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M046.wav|Or not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M000.wav|Good God
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F000.wav|Do you think it's them
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M001.wav|I wonder
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F001.wav|And nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M002.wav|Well it must be them then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F002.wav|What are you going to do
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M003.wav|We're fine right?  Aren't we?  Whatever happens darling
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F003.wav|Now and always sweet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M004.wav|I don't care then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F004.wav|I mean, it was, it's bound to come out sooner or later
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M005.wav|Hello?  Hello?  What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F005.wav|That sent shivers up my spine
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M006.wav|No, wrong number
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M007.wav|What are we to do if they suddenly walk in on us
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F006.wav|Behave exquisitely
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M008.wav|With the most perfect poise
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F007.wav|Certainly.  And I shall probably do a court courtesy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M009.wav|um- Things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy do they
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F008.wav|What is so horrible is that one cannot stay happy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M010.wav|Oh, darling.  Don't say that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F009.wav|It's true.  I mean, the whole business it's a very poor joke
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M011.wav|You mean that, that sacred and beautiful thing love
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F010.wav|Yes.  I mean just that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M012.wav|What does that all mean?  That's what I asked myself on my quest for ultimate truth.  What does it all mean
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F011.wav|Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M013.wav|[LAUGHTER] Oh, darling.  You mustn't be serious, that's just what they want
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F012.wav|Who's they
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M014.wav|All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M015.wav|Laugh at all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings the acid in their damn sweetness and light
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F013.wav|So if I'm to laugh at everything then I must laugh at us too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M016.wav|Oh, certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun alright
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F014.wav|How long will it last?  This ludicrous overbearing love of ours
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M017.wav|Who knows

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_2/Ses03M_script03_2_F043.wav|Oh, yes I am. Yes I am and you can't stop me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_2/Ses03M_script03_2_M044.wav|Just shut up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_2/Ses03M_script03_2_F045.wav|Beast. Brute. Cad. Swine. Beast. Beast. Brute. Devil. Sorry
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_2/Ses03M_script03_2_M046.wav|Oh/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_001.wav|Please call Stella.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_025.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_026.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_027.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_028.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_029.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_030.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_033.wav|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_035.wav|A hostile bid is prevented for another nine months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_036.wav|It was a close call.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_037.wav|In fact, they are the future of investment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_038.wav|Diving is no part of football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_039.wav|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_040.wav|You'd better believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_044.wav|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_045.wav|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_046.wav|No details of the talks were given.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_049.wav|I have learned from him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_051.wav|We are committed to the ban.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_052.wav|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_053.wav|I have made that offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_054.wav|Four other charges were dropped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_056.wav|Clearly, it can go either way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_057.wav|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_058.wav|However, the problem is the timing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_059.wav|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_060.wav|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_061.wav|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_062.wav|I was very pleased with them today, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_063.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_064.wav|It could take some time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_065.wav|There is no pressure on us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_066.wav|It is a job creation scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_067.wav|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_070.wav|That is bound to happen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_071.wav|He is in the queue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_072.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_073.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_081.wav|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_082.wav|That view is held by many others within the industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_083.wav|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_084.wav|He is delighted, and he has every right to be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_086.wav|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_089.wav|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_090.wav|I did not have a bet on myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_092.wav|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_094.wav|That's as it should be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_103.wav|Everyone deserves to share in this success.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_104.wav|His is a success story by any standard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_108.wav|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_109.wav|That might help a bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_110.wav|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_111.wav|It isn't a happy memory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_113.wav|The big issue for us is the review.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_114.wav|I told him I was a long time ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_115.wav|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_116.wav|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_117.wav|We have no influence on the Government's policy on the euro.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_118.wav|We suffered a lot for seven years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_120.wav|The industry is not well organised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_121.wav|You get a lot for your money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_122.wav|I didn't feel under any pressure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_123.wav|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_124.wav|As for the warning, it was not needed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_126.wav|The squad is too small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_127.wav|It is a common problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_128.wav|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_131.wav|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_133.wav|I think he's the favourite.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_135.wav|We have seen a copy of the report.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_136.wav|But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_141.wav|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_142.wav|Well, you can have a tree.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_143.wav|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_144.wav|She will do for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_145.wav|Why change it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_147.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_149.wav|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_150.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_151.wav|Nothing has been put into action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_152.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_153.wav|We have a clean bill of health.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_156.wav|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_157.wav|He was asked to quit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_158.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_159.wav|Neither side can win this war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_165.wav|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_166.wav|Like last month, it is simply too early to make a call.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_169.wav|Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_171.wav|The report was criticised by the Scottish Consumer Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_172.wav|Nobody did in those days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_173.wav|But the story of the play is worth a play in itself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_174.wav|He was a big influence on our decision to make this show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_175.wav|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_176.wav|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_177.wav|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_179.wav|They know no other way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_182.wav|We are just glad to be alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_191.wav|People will ask about us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_192.wav|However, this idea is never developed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_193.wav|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_195.wav|It is hard to tell.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_196.wav|I think, therefore I am ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_197.wav|Who was she ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_199.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_200.wav|It looked like a river.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_201.wav|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_202.wav|The occasion was the New Labour conference in Brighton last year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_203.wav|They have the cash and the fire power.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_208.wav|You are a great player.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_210.wav|Scotland will play its part.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_211.wav|He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_212.wav|After that nothing could save him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_218.wav|We used to live with dignity in our country.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_219.wav|They did not attack the themes of the book.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_220.wav|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_221.wav|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_222.wav|In each case they were a goal down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_223.wav|The police have an awful lot to explain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_224.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_225.wav|It is good for our team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_235.wav|I always felt that I was in control of the match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_236.wav|That will be the criteria for the future.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_237.wav|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_238.wav|Paterson can afford to be generous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_239.wav|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_240.wav|We are in the hat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_241.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_242.wav|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_243.wav|The irony was not lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_244.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_248.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_253.wav|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_254.wav|The problem was a social problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_257.wav|My son was too young to die.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_258.wav|We were not allowed to go to help them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_264.wav|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_265.wav|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_266.wav|No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_268.wav|I realised I was lucky to have it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_273.wav|He has not created a Festival resource.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_274.wav|We have not reached the point of no return.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_275.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_276.wav|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_277.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_279.wav|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_280.wav|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_281.wav|They were not at the property yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_282.wav|It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_285.wav|We have to break that cycle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_286.wav|I wanted to change the formula.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_287.wav|She said the charity would continue to monitor the case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_289.wav|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_290.wav|Scotch beef is badly missed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_291.wav|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_293.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_294.wav|However, we had no failures in our side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_295.wav|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_296.wav|It goes back a long way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_297.wav|Innocent people have a right to live in safety.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_298.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_299.wav|They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_300.wav|I can hardly believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_301.wav|I must do something about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_302.wav|Three hours later, the man was free.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_303.wav|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_305.wav|Cast Away now on general release.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_308.wav|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_309.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_310.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_312.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_314.wav|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_315.wav|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_316.wav|It is beyond the government to deal with this tragedy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_317.wav|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_318.wav|The problem was he thought you were a big man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_319.wav|There's still a bit to go.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_320.wav|We have a good healthy debate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_322.wav|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_323.wav|It is a court case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_324.wav|There is no plan B.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_325.wav|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_326.wav|He will go a long way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_328.wav|It is just a tax on employment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_329.wav|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_330.wav|We are a peaceful people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_331.wav|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_332.wav|It's difficult to predict the future.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_334.wav|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_335.wav|We are in the end game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_336.wav|I came into this world with nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_337.wav|But they have the sound.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_346.wav|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_347.wav|Boy is the town a mess.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_348.wav|Does it matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_349.wav|How do you take them away ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_350.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_351.wav|After the match, do you ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_352.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_353.wav|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_354.wav|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_355.wav|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_356.wav|I said he was set to retire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_357.wav|It is a sign of hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_358.wav|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_359.wav|But we welcome this document.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_363.wav|There is The Beautiful Game to write.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_365.wav|You did not see it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p225/p225_366.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_025.wav|He has not been named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_026.wav|That's no bad thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_027.wav|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_028.wav|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_029.wav|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_030.wav|Because we do not need it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_031.wav|This is the window.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_032.wav|I was an athlete.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_033.wav|From that day on we started to look for another full back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_034.wav|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_036.wav|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_037.wav|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_039.wav|It has failed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_040.wav|It was clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_041.wav|It is not for any other purpose.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_042.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_043.wav|Is there a new way forward?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_044.wav|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_045.wav|This represents a tough game for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_046.wav|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_047.wav|We need to chat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_048.wav|It's a blessing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_049.wav|But it might have done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_050.wav|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_051.wav|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_052.wav|It is the whole package.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_053.wav|He had no enemies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_054.wav|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_055.wav|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_056.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_057.wav|It's the big omission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_058.wav|Next league matches Celtic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_059.wav|She's a spy!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_060.wav|It is unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_061.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_062.wav|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_063.wav|It's a real challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_064.wav|It is not great art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_065.wav|You do not change overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_066.wav|Art is extra.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_067.wav|It's a matter of balance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_068.wav|Scotland had great assets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_069.wav|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_070.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_071.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_072.wav|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_073.wav|The script was funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_074.wav|You need a trademark.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_075.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_076.wav|Help is needed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_077.wav|Tommy is not a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_078.wav|There could be a way back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_079.wav|Neither it is.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_080.wav|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_082.wav|It is a terrible place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_083.wav|It works for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_084.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_085.wav|It can be halted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_086.wav|This is the way things should be handled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_088.wav|Detection is often difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_089.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_090.wav|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_091.wav|Someone who cares
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_092.wav|It's just awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_093.wav|It's never too late.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_094.wav|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_095.wav|That will come after the game on Saturday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_096.wav|However, it did not end that way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_097.wav|We could not get any possession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_098.wav|If you could find it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_099.wav|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_100.wav|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_101.wav|It was mayhem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_102.wav|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_103.wav|They were outside the circle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_104.wav|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_105.wav|May not have been at fault?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_106.wav|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_107.wav|It was a good performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_108.wav|That time is not now, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_109.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_110.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_111.wav|It was an adventure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_112.wav|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_113.wav|The Prime Minister was very saddened to hear about this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_114.wav|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_115.wav|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_116.wav|It is normal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_117.wav|I don't have many friends.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_118.wav|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_119.wav|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_120.wav|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_121.wav|Maybe this battle has been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_122.wav|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_124.wav|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_125.wav|She's got to say something.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_126.wav|It is a delight on every level.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_127.wav|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_128.wav|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_129.wav|She has been shot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_130.wav|I thought it was a fantastic game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_131.wav|I was furious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_132.wav|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_133.wav|She really suffered for her art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_134.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_135.wav|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_136.wav|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_137.wav|It will be too hot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_138.wav|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_139.wav|I am now unemployed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_140.wav|They made such decisions in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_141.wav|Our intentions are real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_142.wav|Government will intervene.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_143.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_144.wav|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_145.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_146.wav|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_148.wav|Three penalties were given.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_149.wav|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_150.wav|We just had a go.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_151.wav|We have seen a copy of the report.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_152.wav|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_153.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_154.wav|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_155.wav|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_156.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_157.wav|Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_158.wav|We will turn the corner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_159.wav|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_160.wav|They should stop the bombing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_161.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_162.wav|It is an attitude of mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_163.wav|I've learned from my mistakes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_164.wav|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_165.wav|We have to move forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_166.wav|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_167.wav|They will do their own thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_168.wav|It is too much for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_169.wav|Nobody did in those days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_171.wav|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_172.wav|It became a book by itself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_173.wav|His team management was protective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_174.wav|It's quite a routine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_175.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_176.wav|If that's the case, he will struggle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_177.wav|I took the gun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_178.wav|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_179.wav|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_180.wav|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_181.wav|I've been there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_183.wav|I have no sympathy with her at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_184.wav|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_185.wav|It is not fair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_186.wav|It just came into my head that day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_187.wav|I had a train to catch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_188.wav|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_189.wav|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_190.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_191.wav|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_192.wav|People will ask about us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_193.wav|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_194.wav|It is a case of taking a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_195.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_197.wav|There was no option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_198.wav|Is that it?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_199.wav|We live by the rule of law.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_200.wav|Is that success?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_201.wav|The service from the other players was super.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_202.wav|They are in the euro.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_203.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_204.wav|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_205.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_206.wav|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_207.wav|It's a mixture of everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_208.wav|I don't want to use it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_209.wav|Now, it's all right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_210.wav|It's like a garage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_211.wav|But I am a worried man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_212.wav|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_213.wav|Feel the heat?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_214.wav|I'm pleased about one thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_215.wav|I am delighted for Simon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_216.wav|His third goal was superb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_217.wav|It's not ideal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_218.wav|I was so nervous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_219.wav|I might come back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_220.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_221.wav|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_223.wav|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_224.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_225.wav|A career as a doctor is on hold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_226.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_227.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_228.wav|I am immensely sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_229.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_230.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_231.wav|The track is currently covered in snow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_232.wav|My wife and family are the support system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_233.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_234.wav|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_235.wav|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_236.wav|It is set in Paris.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_237.wav|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_238.wav|Hospitals are for the ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_239.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_240.wav|She is well balanced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_241.wav|They are all bright and different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_242.wav|It's only fair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_243.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_244.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_245.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_246.wav|His body was never found.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_247.wav|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_248.wav|I was shocked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_249.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_251.wav|There's the mix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_252.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_253.wav|I was never going to play against Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_254.wav|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_255.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_256.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_257.wav|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_258.wav|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_259.wav|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_260.wav|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_261.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_262.wav|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_263.wav|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_264.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_265.wav|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_266.wav|The warning is timely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_267.wav|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_268.wav|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_269.wav|They are never here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_270.wav|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_271.wav|He was popular.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_272.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_273.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_274.wav|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_276.wav|It's a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_278.wav|I feel pretty good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_279.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_280.wav|He has a wealth of experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_281.wav|It happens from time to time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_283.wav|He looked very sharp.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_284.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_285.wav|It was a virus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_286.wav|Yet, it worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_287.wav|Who will perform?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_288.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_289.wav|This is a national crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_290.wav|Scotland were beaten again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_291.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_292.wav|It goes back a long way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_293.wav|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_294.wav|The results are sometimes contentious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_295.wav|He should have won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_296.wav|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_297.wav|There's a pause.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_298.wav|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_299.wav|There was no hint of scandal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_300.wav|I thought it was my only chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_301.wav|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_302.wav|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_303.wav|One was a lawyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_304.wav|Our task is to complete the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_305.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_306.wav|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_307.wav|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_308.wav|This is a war over our home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_309.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_310.wav|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_311.wav|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_312.wav|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_313.wav|The minister is the engineer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_314.wav|I did not name it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_315.wav|It was a question of patience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_316.wav|The whole region is in shock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_317.wav|It's about my time as a guitarist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_318.wav|Kids are terrible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_319.wav|Craig is a major concern for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_320.wav|The home team had an amazing start.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_321.wav|My body is clearly capable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_322.wav|Referees are easy targets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_323.wav|He said she was mad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_324.wav|We are in the end game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_325.wav|I am very happy to be here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_326.wav|The airport was even different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_327.wav|We do the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_328.wav|That's the law of the land.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_329.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_330.wav|The weekly average was three hours.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_331.wav|Donald was his friend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_332.wav|I am so upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_333.wav|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_334.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_335.wav|The boat was fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_336.wav|It is a time bomb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_337.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_338.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_339.wav|My view has now completely changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_340.wav|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_341.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_342.wav|Three years ago he would have been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_343.wav|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_344.wav|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_345.wav|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_346.wav|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_347.wav|It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_348.wav|Look at the witnesses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_349.wav|He's been the key to everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_350.wav|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_351.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_352.wav|His contract was then not renewed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_353.wav|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_354.wav|That is a break with tradition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_355.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_356.wav|She is free.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_357.wav|I kept going for her.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_358.wav|You must have a government and a good civil service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_359.wav|He's very explosive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_360.wav|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_361.wav|Our numbers are small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_362.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_363.wav|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_364.wav|This is a club on the rise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_365.wav|I have got a wife to feed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_366.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_367.wav|Equity declined to comment.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_369.wav|He took over our lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p226/p226_370.wav|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection in the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_025.wav|Meetings will also remain private.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_026.wav|Movement has to take place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_027.wav|I feel I did not have enough time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_028.wav|We will look into it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_029.wav|This is a central issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_030.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_031.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_032.wav|There, you were just a body.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_033.wav|It is not for any other purpose.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_034.wav|President Bush is at war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_035.wav|I became a widow overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_036.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_037.wav|This represents a tough game for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_038.wav|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_039.wav|Among them are many criminals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_040.wav|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_041.wav|He looks like an Afghan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_042.wav|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_043.wav|I'd come back from London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_044.wav|If I was a woman.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_045.wav|He was a home referee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_046.wav|There was no safety net.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_047.wav|The casting of her husband was an accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_048.wav|We have to look beyond the very short term.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_049.wav|I expect a rapid response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_050.wav|That is very hard, alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_051.wav|The motive for the shooting was not known.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_052.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_053.wav|Four other charges were dropped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_054.wav|I could not do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_055.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_056.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_057.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_058.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_059.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_060.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_061.wav|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_062.wav|They have to come up with a solution.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_063.wav|We will pay their bills.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_064.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_065.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_066.wav|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_067.wav|I have proved that in the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_068.wav|He had been a singer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_069.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_070.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_071.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_072.wav|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_073.wav|It is a terrible place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_074.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_075.wav|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_076.wav|There may be reasons for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_077.wav|I first met him last summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_078.wav|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_079.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_080.wav|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_081.wav|By then, he was walking on water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_082.wav|We have to offer value for money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_083.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_084.wav|Potions said he would drive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_085.wav|The latter is due to be finished in February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_086.wav|This is a complex and detailed report.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_087.wav|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_088.wav|We will deal with the refugees.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_089.wav|You might not make it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_090.wav|It is open season on the Old Firm.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_091.wav|That is the important thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_092.wav|For once, you should believe the hype.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_093.wav|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_094.wav|Their attitude is all wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_095.wav|You are like an animal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_096.wav|No, the equipment is extra.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_097.wav|The following are the principal provisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_098.wav|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_099.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_100.wav|I had a fortunate war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_101.wav|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_102.wav|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_103.wav|It was never a starter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_104.wav|And the match was not too bad, either.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_105.wav|Such actions are rarely popular.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_106.wav|It is safe in our hands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_107.wav|Then came the farewell to Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_108.wav|It is much as it has been described.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_109.wav|You can spend money on housing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_110.wav|That admission is not surprising.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_111.wav|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_112.wav|It has removed a bit of guilt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_113.wav|However, we have to be cautious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_114.wav|But we could only help a handful of people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_116.wav|It is just a tax on employment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_117.wav|This should begin in October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_118.wav|My life has changed a lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_119.wav|We did what we had to do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_120.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_121.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_122.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_123.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_124.wav|And does it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_125.wav|You've got to be vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_126.wav|We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_127.wav|Any success would have been an improvement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_128.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_129.wav|And I have some advice for my old friend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_130.wav|He is a great addition to our team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_131.wav|However, this move is dependent upon the sale of the existing site.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_132.wav|I felt he was excellent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_133.wav|They could use a boost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_134.wav|It is a vicious circle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_135.wav|We could easily have lost that game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_136.wav|This is a limited market.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_137.wav|Our position is quite simple.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_138.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_139.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_140.wav|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_141.wav|He's not a Celtic man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_142.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_143.wav|So I got a blood test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_144.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_145.wav|These men are a part of India.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_146.wav|Like the others, he was arrested.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_147.wav|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_148.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_149.wav|That was the difference between the sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_150.wav|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_151.wav|I was shaking on the blocks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_152.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_153.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_154.wav|The strong pound also took its toll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_155.wav|It was a funny feeling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_156.wav|I'd love to be like Peter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_157.wav|Adams is surely worth a chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_158.wav|It is difficult to say.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_159.wav|He was in great spirits.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_160.wav|Seven people were later detained by police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_161.wav|They want to see him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_162.wav|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_163.wav|Nobody did in those days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_164.wav|There is no signature on this document.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_165.wav|We've made a couple of albums.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_166.wav|What happened in that game ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_167.wav|Are you going to win ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_168.wav|Was it the wife ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_169.wav|Why change it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_170.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_171.wav|The people are the hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_172.wav|One season, they might do well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_173.wav|They made such decisions in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_174.wav|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_175.wav|The jury is still out.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_176.wav|But he has a lifeline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_177.wav|The expansions will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_178.wav|I'm just going to hit the shot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_179.wav|It makes no influence on the public.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_180.wav|That will apply to both sets of fans.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_181.wav|I think it's a good sign.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_183.wav|I have spoken to head office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_184.wav|Well, you can have a tree.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_186.wav|They bought the property four years ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_187.wav|He is believed to live in Britain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_188.wav|We've just had it confirmed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_189.wav|A copy of the report will be sent to them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_190.wav|This is the time to use it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_191.wav|You know the sort of thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_192.wav|They were seriously after him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_193.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_194.wav|Trading conditions have not been that bad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_195.wav|I'm interested in interesting work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_196.wav|It will be reviewed in The Herald tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_197.wav|The force is with them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_198.wav|If the director is with you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_199.wav|He made no order on costs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_200.wav|I guess I was lucky, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_201.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_203.wav|It was served by sheriff officers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_204.wav|This will be our new beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_205.wav|They have the cash and the fire power.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_206.wav|My heart is with the artist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_207.wav|That might mean another delay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_208.wav|However, it is not as simple as this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_209.wav|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_210.wav|This is a holy place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_211.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_212.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_213.wav|What are you not good at ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_214.wav|I think, therefore I am ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_215.wav|Who was she ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_216.wav|You have caught a serial killer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_217.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_218.wav|The move follows a review of the Singapore
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_219.wav|They make a selective perception process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_220.wav|There is no quick fix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_222.wav|They have known the hard times.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_223.wav|That might help a bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_226.wav|I'm just a regular person.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_227.wav|My daughter is an adult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_228.wav|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_229.wav|It's just a normal life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_230.wav|He must get to know himself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_231.wav|And the World Cup has not even begun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_232.wav|He remains a main board director of Royal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_233.wav|The fight is under way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_235.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_236.wav|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_237.wav|We can certainly build on this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_238.wav|William Hague delighted his party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_239.wav|There is a world of difference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_240.wav|We played them off the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_241.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_242.wav|I can't wait to meet him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_243.wav|My wife and family are the support system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_244.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_245.wav|It is the voice of the survivors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_246.wav|She died in middle age.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_247.wav|It is set in Paris.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_248.wav|You will have seen the adverts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_249.wav|It is possible to be too good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_250.wav|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_251.wav|They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_252.wav|The irony was not lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_253.wav|Three weeks later, he resigned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_254.wav|It is a court case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_255.wav|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_256.wav|She took them for a term.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_257.wav|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_258.wav|Nato was not a love affair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_259.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_260.wav|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_261.wav|You can feel at home in China.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_262.wav|Our decision making was poor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_263.wav|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_264.wav|The baby deserves the credit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_265.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_266.wav|Was everything done to save people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_267.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_268.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_269.wav|Is it in the right place ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_270.wav|Did he trip ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_271.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_272.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_273.wav|No production contract is yet in sight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_274.wav|The capital costs are modest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_275.wav|This is no reflection on Rangers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_276.wav|I told you I was ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_277.wav|I can't get a job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_278.wav|That could be in place by next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_279.wav|On the contrary they stand to gain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_280.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_281.wav|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_282.wav|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_283.wav|Every one is a winner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_284.wav|There's not much money in cycling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_285.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_286.wav|Not many companies can say that these days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_287.wav|They can leave at any time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_288.wav|You get a lot for your money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_289.wav|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_290.wav|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_291.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_292.wav|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_293.wav|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_294.wav|But the plot is not the point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_295.wav|It was never a free kick.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_296.wav|My body is a wreck.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_297.wav|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_298.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_299.wav|She failed in her action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_300.wav|Stephen will get his first cap.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_301.wav|It's hard to see it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_302.wav|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_303.wav|We have to be very, very careful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_304.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_305.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_306.wav|It is an amazing response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_307.wav|Size is not the issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_308.wav|He will address the nation this evening.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_309.wav|We have the easy part.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_310.wav|We are not increasing the number.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_311.wav|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_312.wav|They do not reflect the quality of the brand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_313.wav|It could well be military.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_314.wav|And that culture is everywhere in Dublin.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_315.wav|His job was not advertised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_316.wav|This is a big step up.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_317.wav|It goes back a long way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_318.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_319.wav|We have a clean bill of health.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_320.wav|In that case, the children were not missing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_321.wav|I have got a victim.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_322.wav|The judge was really nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_323.wav|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_324.wav|McNaughton was not so sure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_326.wav|The dealer is on notice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_327.wav|It is hoped to complete the merger in the summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_328.wav|The party lasted all night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_329.wav|He would help me with the form.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_330.wav|There's still a bit to go.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_331.wav|I'm not worried about the critics.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_332.wav|I would do away with the dress code.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_333.wav|It is so easy to be negative.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_334.wav|What form did that take ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_335.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_336.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_337.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_338.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_339.wav|So what happens next ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_340.wav|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_341.wav|I am not obsessed with sex.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_342.wav|Have a look at this lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_343.wav|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_344.wav|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_345.wav|The king is delighted by the honour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_347.wav|I've got a sense of humour, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_348.wav|In the old days, it was easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_349.wav|I came into this world with nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_350.wav|This is a trend which will be encouraged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_351.wav|There will have to be a full inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_352.wav|There was no time scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_353.wav|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_354.wav|Whether this return was too soon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_355.wav|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_356.wav|They were the acts of men.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_357.wav|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_358.wav|Of course, we want to go home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_359.wav|I am very interested in the subject.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_360.wav|He is not very big, either.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_361.wav|A report is expected next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_363.wav|We are encouraged by the news.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_364.wav|Had this been common practice ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_365.wav|What do they want us to do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_366.wav|Is it worth it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_367.wav|Does it matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_368.wav|A crucial moment has arrived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_369.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_370.wav|We need to be prepared.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_371.wav|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_372.wav|His views are hardly surprising.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_373.wav|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_374.wav|It has been made to entertain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_375.wav|It is a stroke of genius.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_376.wav|Italy was just behind the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_377.wav|It was forced to divert.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_378.wav|Alex Ferguson is the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_379.wav|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_380.wav|We are still getting over it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_382.wav|This will impact on us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_383.wav|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_384.wav|He is in the queue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_385.wav|The salary changes are long overdue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_386.wav|I do not like to lose.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_387.wav|I am a member of the Labour Party staff.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_388.wav|There is no deal as yet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_389.wav|In due course the deal was done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_390.wav|Celtic were pleased to help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_391.wav|They will fight for everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_392.wav|That's not like us at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_393.wav|You have to rely on each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_394.wav|I wanted to go out on a high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_395.wav|I felt the head was very like me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_396.wav|It is a terrible equation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_397.wav|They have not got anyone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_398.wav|I can hardly believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_399.wav|How do you take them away ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_400.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_401.wav|After the match, do you ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p227/p227_402.wav|Persuaded to change his mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_001.wav|Please call Stella.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_025.wav|It's nice to hear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_026.wav|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_027.wav|Because we do not need it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_028.wav|There's a story, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_029.wav|I feel I did not have enough time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_030.wav|Life was like a timetable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_031.wav|He took me on a tour of the wards.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_032.wav|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_033.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_034.wav|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_035.wav|It was clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_036.wav|The problem is the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_037.wav|Indeed, he does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_038.wav|President Bush is at war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_039.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_040.wav|My whole life has changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_041.wav|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_042.wav|No meaningful response was issued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_043.wav|It is urgent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_044.wav|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_045.wav|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_046.wav|We need to chat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_047.wav|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_048.wav|The Scottish Parliament is also looking at similar measures.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_049.wav|But it might have done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_050.wav|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_051.wav|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_052.wav|He looks like an Afghan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_053.wav|Here's a clue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_054.wav|It had been in place since last July.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_055.wav|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_056.wav|That's the day job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_057.wav|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_058.wav|That's the truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_059.wav|That is very hard, alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_060.wav|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_061.wav|Four other charges were dropped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_062.wav|They're appalled by that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_063.wav|There was a battle there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_064.wav|Scotland had great assets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_065.wav|It's that kind of place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_066.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_067.wav|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_068.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_069.wav|He is a young man with a new deal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_070.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_071.wav|The script was funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_072.wav|Try to save us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_073.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_074.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_075.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_076.wav|It's all I can do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_077.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_078.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_079.wav|I had my suspicions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_081.wav|People must remain vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_082.wav|Today she has been released.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_083.wav|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_084.wav|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_085.wav|But she might be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_086.wav|Nothing is yet confirmed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_087.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_088.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_089.wav|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_090.wav|Now the system is right behind us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_091.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_092.wav|Today I couldn't run on it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_093.wav|However, it did not end that way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_094.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_095.wav|Safety was also an issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_096.wav|It is an old family habit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_097.wav|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_098.wav|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_099.wav|It is annoying.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_100.wav|We could not get any possession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_101.wav|I love the Dome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_102.wav|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_103.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_104.wav|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_105.wav|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_106.wav|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_107.wav|It is a good day for the coalition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_108.wav|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_109.wav|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_110.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_111.wav|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_112.wav|We have an election in eight days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_113.wav|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_114.wav|They will want to perform well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_115.wav|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_116.wav|However, they will only be found in the wild.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_117.wav|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_118.wav|Further protests are likely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_119.wav|It's in his blood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_120.wav|I don't want to use the term.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_121.wav|The picture is the same across Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_122.wav|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_123.wav|It is so sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_124.wav|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_125.wav|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_126.wav|Who would be a referee ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_127.wav|They've got to account for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_128.wav|It is a delight on every level.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_129.wav|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_130.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_131.wav|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_132.wav|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_133.wav|This plan is an agenda for action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_134.wav|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_135.wav|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_136.wav|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_137.wav|Who will attend ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_138.wav|We had a reunion last week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_139.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_140.wav|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_141.wav|I was the last man to touch the ball.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_142.wav|He was in a great deal of pain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_143.wav|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_144.wav|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_145.wav|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_146.wav|I think he's the favourite, no question.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_147.wav|Who would be right ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_148.wav|It is difficult for Ali.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_149.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_150.wav|Had she enjoyed the experience ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_151.wav|That should do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_152.wav|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_153.wav|It is not just about pay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_154.wav|I am just trying to do my job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_155.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_156.wav|The home side didn't stand a chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_157.wav|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_158.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_159.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_160.wav|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_161.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_162.wav|It was by the numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_163.wav|I was in daily contact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_164.wav|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_165.wav|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_166.wav|It was so new, so exciting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_167.wav|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_168.wav|I've put my own money into this project.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_169.wav|Eight months later, he was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_170.wav|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_171.wav|We have to move forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_172.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_173.wav|We have to sort it out ourselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_174.wav|The post will be unpaid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_175.wav|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_176.wav|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_177.wav|We've made a couple of albums.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_178.wav|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_179.wav|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_180.wav|One season, they might do well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_181.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_182.wav|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_183.wav|The hotel was now for sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_184.wav|I drove the ball well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_185.wav|I took the gun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_186.wav|We knew nothing about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_187.wav|They will run a mile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_188.wav|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_189.wav|Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_190.wav|Miller was every bit as happy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_191.wav|I put the drawing down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_192.wav|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_193.wav|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_194.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_195.wav|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_196.wav|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_197.wav|The procedure is the same in all cases.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_198.wav|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_199.wav|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_200.wav|I wanted to put myself on the line.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_202.wav|It's the same old story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_203.wav|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_204.wav|Is that success ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_205.wav|I have a cold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_206.wav|They are in the euro.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_207.wav|Ferguson should take note.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_208.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_209.wav|Who will pay for this ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_210.wav|They've got three-quarters of the way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_211.wav|He had suffered a heart attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_212.wav|A deadline is still essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_213.wav|Yet she is still the woman behind the famous man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_214.wav|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_215.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_216.wav|That will be vital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_217.wav|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_218.wav|That is an important part of our role.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_219.wav|She should not be blamed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_220.wav|I had decided to quit the show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_221.wav|His third goal was superb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_222.wav|It's been a good year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_223.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_224.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_225.wav|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_226.wav|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_227.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_228.wav|It is a gamble.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_229.wav|It's so special.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_230.wav|You take a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_231.wav|He is severe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_232.wav|We just had a go.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_233.wav|We are in the hat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_234.wav|We were a load of rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_235.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_236.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_237.wav|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_238.wav|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_239.wav|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_240.wav|She was well balanced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_241.wav|It's only fair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_242.wav|He says that he is no different from any other man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_243.wav|You can feel at home in China.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_244.wav|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_245.wav|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_246.wav|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_247.wav|He's a lovely young man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_248.wav|It was a hit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_249.wav|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_250.wav|I can't get a job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_251.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_252.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_253.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_254.wav|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_255.wav|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_256.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_257.wav|Is that a serious question ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_258.wav|They are real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_259.wav|They must play for each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_260.wav|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_261.wav|His contract was then not renewed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_262.wav|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_263.wav|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_264.wav|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_265.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_266.wav|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_267.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_268.wav|I was rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_269.wav|He's been here on numerous occasions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_270.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_271.wav|It's a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_272.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_274.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_275.wav|They were too hard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_276.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_277.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_278.wav|All options are open.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_279.wav|He will address the nation this evening.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_280.wav|We want to see the maximum of change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_281.wav|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_282.wav|He was obviously very genuine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_283.wav|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_284.wav|It changed my life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_285.wav|The songs are just so good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_286.wav|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_287.wav|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_288.wav|It became a book by itself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_289.wav|The home was now under new management.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_290.wav|Graeme was prepared.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_291.wav|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_292.wav|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_293.wav|Our task is to complete the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_294.wav|They are wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_295.wav|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_296.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_297.wav|You are the glory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_298.wav|It's certainly different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_299.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_300.wav|We want to play at the worlds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_301.wav|We have waited a long time for this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_302.wav|Is there on his hands ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_303.wav|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_304.wav|It's not even finished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_305.wav|We are a peaceful people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_306.wav|Kids are terrible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_307.wav|The problems began a long time ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_308.wav|This film will be totally awesome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_309.wav|He said she was mad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_310.wav|There was some merit in that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_311.wav|I am very happy to be here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_312.wav|We do the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_313.wav|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_315.wav|It's not long enough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_316.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_317.wav|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_318.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_319.wav|Is that an issue ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_320.wav|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_321.wav|Robert is a special talent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_322.wav|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_323.wav|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_324.wav|There was no option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_325.wav|The same things will happen with GM foods.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_326.wav|It is a sign of hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_327.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_328.wav|It has moved on in the last week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_329.wav|The train was on time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_330.wav|It is so unfair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_331.wav|He has to learn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_332.wav|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_333.wav|I've got no secret.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_334.wav|Tiger is the exception.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_335.wav|A great deal has been achieved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_336.wav|It was forced to divert.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_337.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_338.wav|This is a friendly match ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_339.wav|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_340.wav|He's a genius.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_341.wav|They should take their mobile phones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_342.wav|It is not like working for a living.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_343.wav|It's the last thing on my mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_344.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_345.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_346.wav|That is a break with tradition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_347.wav|She is free.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_348.wav|Everyone was in tears.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_349.wav|You must have a government and a good civil service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_350.wav|As, indeed, they would be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_351.wav|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_352.wav|I expected these kind of questions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_353.wav|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_354.wav|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_355.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_356.wav|Equity declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_357.wav|He later became a respected High Court judge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_358.wav|The play is based on a real-life event.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_359.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_360.wav|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_361.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_362.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_363.wav|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_364.wav|It is a simple equation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_365.wav|So there, we won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_366.wav|But I managed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_367.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_368.wav|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_369.wav|There is no signature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_370.wav|It's a record label, not a form of music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p228/p228_371.wav|It became a national network.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_025.wav|Johnson was pretty low.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_026.wav|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_027.wav|It's nice to hear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_028.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_029.wav|I have a theory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_030.wav|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_031.wav|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_032.wav|Because we do not need it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_033.wav|And we have a singer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_034.wav|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_035.wav|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_036.wav|I'd like to continue that record.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_037.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_038.wav|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_039.wav|They're just different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_040.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_041.wav|It is not for any other purpose.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_042.wav|He did not know his daughter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_043.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_044.wav|I was scared.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_045.wav|It will come all right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_046.wav|But it took a lot of bottle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_047.wav|But it is all by design.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_048.wav|I am just going to go for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_050.wav|We need to chat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_051.wav|It is difficult for Ali.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_052.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_053.wav|A recording contract is on the horizon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_054.wav|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_055.wav|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_056.wav|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_057.wav|She's a spy !
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_058.wav|What was the main difference ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_059.wav|My mother is a widow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_060.wav|And a film maker was born.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_061.wav|Art is extra.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_062.wav|Scotland had great assets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_063.wav|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_064.wav|We should have known.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_065.wav|It is like a river running by my home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_066.wav|Try to save us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_067.wav|That was the easy election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_068.wav|I was as strong as a horse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_069.wav|Ferguson should take note.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_070.wav|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_071.wav|Neither it is.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_072.wav|She died in hospital two hours later.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_073.wav|It was chaotic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_074.wav|It is a job creation scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_075.wav|It works for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_076.wav|I've not thought about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_077.wav|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_078.wav|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_079.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_080.wav|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_081.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_082.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_083.wav|Someone who cares
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_084.wav|He can do everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_085.wav|By then, he was walking on water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_086.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_087.wav|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_088.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_089.wav|It is a lifeline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_090.wav|However, it did not end that way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_091.wav|We must look forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_092.wav|It is an old family habit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_093.wav|Well, the big day has arrived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_094.wav|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_095.wav|Until you hit the big games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_096.wav|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_097.wav|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_098.wav|She's got to say something.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_099.wav|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_100.wav|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_101.wav|She has so much to offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_102.wav|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_103.wav|It is a good day for the coalition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_104.wav|We work on the same level.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_105.wav|They were outside the circle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_106.wav|Two of the team became ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_108.wav|I didn't play well last year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_109.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_110.wav|I'm not depressed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_111.wav|It is normal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_112.wav|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_113.wav|I don't have many friends.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_114.wav|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_115.wav|I came to complete.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_116.wav|I was angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_117.wav|They were behind the wheel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_118.wav|The fire was above the hole.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_119.wav|It's not fair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_120.wav|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_121.wav|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_122.wav|Maybe this battle has been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_123.wav|I'm delighted about that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_124.wav|I joined a group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_125.wav|It is rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_126.wav|Who would be a referee ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_127.wav|It was my own fault and I lost a lot of belief.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_128.wav|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_129.wav|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_130.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_131.wav|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_132.wav|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_133.wav|She really suffered for her art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_134.wav|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_135.wav|It's an amazing landscape !
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_136.wav|So the European elections are extremely important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_137.wav|He is slightly confused.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_138.wav|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_139.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_140.wav|They took a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_141.wav|Government will intervene.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_142.wav|What will happen then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_143.wav|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_144.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_145.wav|This represents a tough game for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_146.wav|I was the last man to touch the ball.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_147.wav|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_148.wav|Three penalties were given.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_149.wav|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_150.wav|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_151.wav|Who would be right ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_152.wav|We just had a go.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_153.wav|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_154.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_155.wav|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_156.wav|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_157.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_158.wav|The home side didn't stand a chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_159.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_160.wav|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_161.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_162.wav|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_163.wav|It was by the numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_164.wav|I knew he was good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_165.wav|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_166.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_167.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_168.wav|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_169.wav|Was this element always there ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_170.wav|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_171.wav|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_172.wav|I will tell you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_173.wav|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_174.wav|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_175.wav|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_176.wav|We have to move forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_177.wav|It's that sort of night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_178.wav|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_179.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_180.wav|The post will be unpaid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_181.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_182.wav|It is a memorial.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_183.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_184.wav|They thought they had found a home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_185.wav|One season, they might do well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_186.wav|Is Saddam a threat ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_187.wav|The home was now under new management.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_188.wav|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_189.wav|The hotel was now for sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_190.wav|I drove the ball well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_191.wav|It is the whole package.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_192.wav|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_193.wav|We knew nothing about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_194.wav|It is minute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_195.wav|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_196.wav|Four policemen were wounded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_197.wav|What has caused the demise of singing ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_198.wav|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_199.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_200.wav|I've got good news and bad news for you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_201.wav|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_202.wav|People will ask about us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_203.wav|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_204.wav|Last night was a key episode.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_205.wav|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_206.wav|It wasn't to be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_207.wav|I wanted to put myself on the line.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_209.wav|I came home by ambulance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_210.wav|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_211.wav|It's the same old story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_212.wav|But we are not immune to the problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_213.wav|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_214.wav|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_215.wav|The procedures were not in place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_216.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_217.wav|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_218.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_219.wav|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_220.wav|That is an important part of our role.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_221.wav|She should not be blamed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_222.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_223.wav|I am delighted for Simon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_224.wav|I had decided to quit the show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_225.wav|The FBI could become involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_226.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_227.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_228.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_229.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_230.wav|Who was on the panel ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_231.wav|We've got the bronze.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_232.wav|Saturday is gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_233.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_234.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_235.wav|The boy is no longer with us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_236.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_237.wav|The track is currently covered in snow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_238.wav|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_239.wav|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_240.wav|We are so proud.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_241.wav|We were a load of rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_242.wav|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_243.wav|It's an idea.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_244.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_245.wav|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_246.wav|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_247.wav|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_248.wav|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_249.wav|The letters are going out today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_250.wav|It's only fair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_251.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_252.wav|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_253.wav|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_254.wav|It was a hit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_255.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_256.wav|This year I understood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_257.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_258.wav|Kirkwood was arrested.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_259.wav|This is a big club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_260.wav|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_261.wav|I was happily surprised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_262.wav|They must play for each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_263.wav|The pensioners did not want to know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_264.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_265.wav|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_266.wav|That is highly unfair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_267.wav|The warning is timely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_268.wav|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_269.wav|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_270.wav|They are never here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_271.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_272.wav|He was also married with two children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_273.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_274.wav|We're in shock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_275.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_277.wav|It's a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_278.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_279.wav|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_280.wav|I am an estate agent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_281.wav|People have no choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_282.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_283.wav|It was a privilege to work for him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_284.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_285.wav|If not, he should go home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_286.wav|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_287.wav|I saw it at a ruck.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_288.wav|I felt like I was a child.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_289.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_290.wav|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_292.wav|We have other options.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_293.wav|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_294.wav|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_295.wav|These figures are truly awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_296.wav|Sunday's game was not a trial.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_297.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_298.wav|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_300.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_301.wav|I thought it was my only chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_302.wav|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_303.wav|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_304.wav|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_305.wav|There is no openness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_306.wav|This is a war over our home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_307.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_308.wav|It's just not funny !
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_309.wav|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_310.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_311.wav|You are the glory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_312.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_313.wav|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_314.wav|It's certainly different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_315.wav|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_316.wav|This is the culture change in medicine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_318.wav|It's about my time as a guitarist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_319.wav|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_320.wav|It's not even finished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_322.wav|It should be equal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_323.wav|Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_324.wav|We are very strongly behind the bid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_325.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_326.wav|I am very happy to be here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_328.wav|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_329.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_330.wav|It could have gone either way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_331.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_332.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_333.wav|She did not attend the courtroom.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_334.wav|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_335.wav|He told the court.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_336.wav|The team for the first game could be this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_337.wav|They haven't got a hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_338.wav|It has moved on in the last week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_339.wav|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_340.wav|He did a good job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_341.wav|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_342.wav|Today she has been released.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_343.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_344.wav|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_345.wav|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_346.wav|Indeed, it was magical.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_347.wav|I've got no secret.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_348.wav|Look at the witnesses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_349.wav|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_350.wav|I'm very lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_351.wav|They may yet have the last laugh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_352.wav|Everything was an effort.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_353.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_354.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_355.wav|It is long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_356.wav|It's the last thing on my mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_357.wav|Tell us about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_358.wav|There is a cup final at stake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_359.wav|That is a break with tradition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_360.wav|It was very formal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_361.wav|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_362.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_363.wav|It benefits the whole family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_364.wav|It was fit for royalty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_365.wav|We are looking for perfection.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_366.wav|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_367.wav|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_368.wav|I am a star.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_369.wav|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_370.wav|He could make it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_371.wav|He later became a respected High Court judge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_373.wav|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_374.wav|It is not too late to get on board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_376.wav|It is a simple equation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_377.wav|Talks are progressing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_378.wav|They play together perfectly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_379.wav|It's a long process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_380.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_381.wav|It does not even have a staff shortage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_382.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_384.wav|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_386.wav|Three years ago he would have been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_387.wav|That team is due to be announced this morning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_388.wav|It has been a lovely family occasion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_389.wav|That's the name of the game, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_390.wav|There were no casualties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_391.wav|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p229/p229_392.wav|Yet the data is compelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_025.wav|It is on the internet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_026.wav|Smoking is also very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_027.wav|He has the courage of the unaware.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_028.wav|Life was like a timetable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_029.wav|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_030.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_031.wav|I'm so happy that she did.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_032.wav|The wedding was in Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_033.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_034.wav|He really is a lovely man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_035.wav|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_036.wav|This represents a tough game for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_037.wav|The boy is no longer with us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_038.wav|They said she was stable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_039.wav|This will save interest charges.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_040.wav|Well, he is an artist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_041.wav|He looks like an Afghan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_042.wav|People want to see me on the screen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_043.wav|The big problem is the lack of grass.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_044.wav|That was the theory, anyway.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_045.wav|I was inspired by two things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_046.wav|If not, he should go home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_047.wav|I must take a seat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_048.wav|It was bound to happen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_049.wav|We have to bring in new players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_050.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_051.wav|I have made that offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_052.wav|None has ever been found.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_053.wav|Four other charges were dropped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_054.wav|We should be able to cope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_055.wav|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_056.wav|We will pay their bills.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_057.wav|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_058.wav|It was exactly four months away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_059.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_060.wav|It's not covered by the insurance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_061.wav|But the challenge is in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_062.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_063.wav|The tournament has now been cancelled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_064.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_065.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_066.wav|He also received a medal of honour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_068.wav|It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_069.wav|It is a job creation scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_070.wav|It looks like a hit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_071.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_072.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_073.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_074.wav|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_075.wav|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_076.wav|Consumer confidence remains an issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_077.wav|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_078.wav|This is a true story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_079.wav|By then, he was walking on water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_080.wav|It's so hard to shift.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_081.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_083.wav|It might change your life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_084.wav|You are a great player.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_085.wav|However, it did not end that way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_086.wav|We will deal with the refugees.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_087.wav|It was not an insult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_088.wav|You might not make it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_089.wav|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_090.wav|I did not have a bet on myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_091.wav|The conclusion is the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_092.wav|He was prepared for this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_093.wav|But I know the course.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_094.wav|You are like an animal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_095.wav|We intend to change the model.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_096.wav|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_097.wav|Two of the team became ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_099.wav|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_100.wav|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_101.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_102.wav|This was a good move for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_103.wav|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_104.wav|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_105.wav|It is close to call.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_106.wav|It is an impressive record.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_107.wav|It is a total and utter change of culture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_108.wav|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_109.wav|Abbey National is an option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_110.wav|The arrival of the Scottish Premier League has also presented a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_112.wav|We have the mental strength.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_113.wav|You can spend money on housing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_114.wav|That admission is not surprising.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_115.wav|I can't even get into the A team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_116.wav|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_117.wav|Which can happen any time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_118.wav|It is too pretty, it is too small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_119.wav|But this time we can have no excuses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_120.wav|They are very happy with the new settlement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_121.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_122.wav|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_123.wav|We did what we had to do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_124.wav|She was also very brave.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_125.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_126.wav|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_127.wav|The opposite is the case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_128.wav|He was a home referee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_129.wav|This is a successful outcome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_130.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_131.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_132.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_133.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_134.wav|It was a piece of art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_135.wav|I would relish the prospect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_137.wav|These men are a part of India.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_138.wav|I was caught out a little bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_139.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_140.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_141.wav|It has to be an event.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_142.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_143.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_144.wav|The first thing is to assess the damage that has been done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_145.wav|She has gone to the Catholic school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_146.wav|It was by the numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_147.wav|I am not going to make any further comment, apart from that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_148.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_149.wav|However, he was later released without charge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_150.wav|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_151.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_152.wav|I'm afraid to say anything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_153.wav|We are still getting over it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_154.wav|It has to be now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_155.wav|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_156.wav|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_157.wav|They will do their own thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_158.wav|You had to go and see him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_159.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_160.wav|And does it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_161.wav|Are you from the rugby ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_162.wav|Had I heard ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_163.wav|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_164.wav|Our position remains the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_165.wav|Nobody did in those days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_166.wav|We believe in the medium term.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_167.wav|It's nice to be nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_168.wav|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_169.wav|On the month the weakness was across the board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_170.wav|One season, they might do well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_171.wav|Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_172.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_173.wav|But he has a lifeline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_174.wav|Phase one was a shambles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_175.wav|City sentiment is in his favour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_176.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_177.wav|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_178.wav|Tomorrow is a new day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_179.wav|It makes no influence on the public.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_180.wav|She has left the island.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_181.wav|He played it like a veteran.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_182.wav|I have spoken to head office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_183.wav|They will run a mile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_184.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_185.wav|Our destiny is in our own hands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_186.wav|He prefers to play for them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_188.wav|He lives in a neighbouring village.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_189.wav|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_190.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_191.wav|We represent a wide range of society.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_192.wav|We always felt we could win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_194.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_195.wav|It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_196.wav|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_198.wav|I made a terrible start.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_199.wav|The result is called a patent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_200.wav|We played them off the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_201.wav|Racism has no place in any sport.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_202.wav|Tommy is not a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_203.wav|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_204.wav|This is a holy place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_205.wav|He had suffered a heart attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_206.wav|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_207.wav|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_208.wav|This will take several weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_209.wav|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_210.wav|We have an election in eight days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_211.wav|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_212.wav|There is no quick fix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_213.wav|All will be revealed in due course.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_214.wav|We used to live with dignity in our country.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_215.wav|The most exciting room is the final one of the show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_216.wav|He has made his base in Spain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_217.wav|My life is in the ballet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_218.wav|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_219.wav|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_220.wav|His second was a beauty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_221.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_222.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_223.wav|How do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_224.wav|What are you not good at ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_225.wav|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_226.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_227.wav|It was a day for records.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_228.wav|He remains a main board director of Royal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_230.wav|That has been the easy part.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_231.wav|Things were so intense in the studio.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_232.wav|I was not sure whether I had won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_233.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_234.wav|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_235.wav|It is the voice of the survivors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_236.wav|It had so much to do with output.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_237.wav|Must have been at the bar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_238.wav|She died in middle age.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_239.wav|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_240.wav|They need to win a trophy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_241.wav|Half the young people had had contact with the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_242.wav|It is possible to be too good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_243.wav|In many ways, that is as important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_244.wav|Here is a question for you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_245.wav|I was just a kid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_246.wav|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_247.wav|Hospitals are for the ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_248.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_249.wav|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_250.wav|We have to compete at our own level.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_251.wav|They showed a lot of heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_252.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_253.wav|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_254.wav|She took them for a term.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_255.wav|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_257.wav|Nato was not a love affair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_258.wav|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_259.wav|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_260.wav|In fact, we were all over the shop.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_261.wav|You can feel at home in China.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_262.wav|Persuaded to change his mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_263.wav|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_264.wav|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_265.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_266.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_267.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_268.wav|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_269.wav|I've had no discussions with the chairman of the board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_270.wav|I was ready for this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_271.wav|On the contrary they stand to gain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_272.wav|They are interior designers and architects.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_273.wav|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_274.wav|We feel very good about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_276.wav|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_277.wav|It is also very valuable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_278.wav|None of this work is guaranteed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_279.wav|There is a case to answer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_280.wav|We're trying to get rounded performers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_281.wav|They can leave at any time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_282.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_283.wav|was everything done to save people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_284.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_285.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_286.wav|That was a gold medal for certain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_287.wav|You get a lot for your money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_288.wav|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_289.wav|In that moment, I was happy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_290.wav|The actor has met with Mandela.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_291.wav|It was never a free kick.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_292.wav|It is a recipe for success.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_293.wav|I would rather look at him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_295.wav|It's got to come from me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_296.wav|It took a month and a half to film.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_297.wav|The cause of the accident remained unclear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_298.wav|It is a symbolic concert.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_299.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_300.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_302.wav|He is at war with his knee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_303.wav|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_304.wav|I was there five months ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_305.wav|You have to see it like this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_306.wav|Rugby is now just like football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_307.wav|It could well be military.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_308.wav|His job was not advertised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_309.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_310.wav|We have a clean bill of health.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_311.wav|And we can do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_312.wav|The songs are just so good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_313.wav|The casting is as perfect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_314.wav|I can hardly believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_315.wav|I must do something about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_316.wav|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_317.wav|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_318.wav|They are not left wing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_319.wav|McNaughton was not so sure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_321.wav|It is a road of death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_322.wav|The party lasted all night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_323.wav|The group is not paying a dividend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_324.wav|We were on our way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_325.wav|I was as strong as a horse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_326.wav|That meant the search was unlawful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_327.wav|We have a good healthy debate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_328.wav|I would do away with the dress code.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_329.wav|We are on a four-year mission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_330.wav|This is a historic occasion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_331.wav|This ruling is a farce.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_332.wav|I can see their argument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_333.wav|After some discussion they did.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_334.wav|It was always an option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_335.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_336.wav|Did it work ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_337.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_338.wav|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_339.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_340.wav|You may have a short memory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_341.wav|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_342.wav|In the old days, it was easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_343.wav|There was some merit in that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_344.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_345.wav|The airport was even different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_346.wav|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_347.wav|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_348.wav|There was no time scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_349.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_350.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_351.wav|He is not very big, either.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_352.wav|I have a moral dilemma.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_353.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_354.wav|You have no chance of planning permission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_355.wav|We are encouraged by the news.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_356.wav|In addition, certain areas closed at certain times.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_357.wav|The professor said the results were positive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_358.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_359.wav|Three years ago he would have been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_360.wav|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_361.wav|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_362.wav|I am a lucky man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_363.wav|Nobody else was with me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_364.wav|We put our bid in last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_365.wav|Alex Ferguson is the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_366.wav|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_367.wav|But BA said the prediction was premature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_368.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_369.wav|They have broken the promise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_370.wav|We are really good friends.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_371.wav|My goal is quite simple.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_372.wav|This is a major championship.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_373.wav|It's going to be fun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_374.wav|She is now on the back benches.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_375.wav|Scrutiny by European Parliament is limited.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_376.wav|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_377.wav|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_378.wav|We are a Scottish company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_379.wav|We will win the argument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_380.wav|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_381.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_382.wav|I always knew she was funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_383.wav|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_384.wav|The marshall at the turn was great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_385.wav|If you can get it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_386.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_387.wav|There was a substantial explosion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_388.wav|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_389.wav|He could face a jail sentence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_390.wav|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_391.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_392.wav|Clark is back on top form.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_393.wav|Motion described it as a unique event.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_394.wav|I had a fortunate war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_395.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_396.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_397.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_398.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_399.wav|That investment has now been secured.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_400.wav|It is a large number.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_401.wav|You will not feel a thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_402.wav|I've never seen a game like it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_404.wav|It does not even have a staff shortage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_405.wav|It was a bank holiday, after all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_406.wav|We're obviously disturbed by this case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_407.wav|The casualties were not named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_408.wav|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_409.wav|It had been on the cards.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_410.wav|The second goal was superb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_411.wav|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_413.wav|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_414.wav|It is the old story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_415.wav|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_416.wav|No date has been set for a meeting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p230/p230_417.wav|We have to build a new team in the minimum of time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_025.wav|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_026.wav|I'd just like to play.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_027.wav|Because we do not need it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_028.wav|There was a rush of water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_029.wav|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_030.wav|That deal is a joke.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_031.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_032.wav|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_033.wav|It carried a double message.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_034.wav|That means an extra two years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_035.wav|I became a widow overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_036.wav|But he can turn on the charm.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_037.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_038.wav|The man became a reporter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_039.wav|Mr Blair last night attended his weekly audience with the Queen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_040.wav|Last year, I was pretty bad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_041.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_042.wav|Among them are many criminals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_043.wav|He looks like an Afghan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_044.wav|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_045.wav|I guess I was lucky, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_046.wav|I was inspired by two things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_047.wav|A win is a win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_048.wav|There was no safety net.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_049.wav|There's nothing we could do about this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_050.wav|It is a symbolic concert.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_051.wav|We keep an eye on it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_052.wav|We have not given up hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_053.wav|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_054.wav|She said she was really sorry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_055.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_056.wav|Italy is a beautiful place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_057.wav|Four other charges were dropped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_058.wav|We should be able to cope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_059.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_061.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_062.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_063.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_064.wav|It was a lovely experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_065.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_066.wav|We will pay their bills.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_067.wav|Only water is currently allowed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_068.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_069.wav|We need to increase the membership.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_070.wav|This is an exciting new venture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_071.wav|He highlighted a lack of staff.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_072.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_073.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_074.wav|Both men were on one-year contracts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_076.wav|That would be too easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_078.wav|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_079.wav|Both agreed on the success of the event.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_080.wav|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_081.wav|On Saturday, it was much the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_082.wav|It's so hard to shift.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_083.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_085.wav|However, it did not end that way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_086.wav|Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_087.wav|It is an old family habit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_088.wav|He's been hit by it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_089.wav|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_090.wav|I saw the whole thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_091.wav|But I know the course.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_092.wav|Their attitude is all wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_093.wav|We must stop it with the golf ball.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_094.wav|You are like an animal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_095.wav|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_097.wav|We should recognise others have done a good job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_098.wav|We live by the rule of law.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_099.wav|Two of the team became ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_100.wav|No, the equipment is extra.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_101.wav|That time is not now, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_102.wav|It's not a quick fix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_103.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_104.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_105.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_106.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_107.wav|And does it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_108.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_109.wav|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_110.wav|You'd better believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_111.wav|New Year will be very busy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_112.wav|There's still plenty time left.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_113.wav|It proved a good decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_114.wav|Maybe this battle has been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_115.wav|January is a bad time of year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_116.wav|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_117.wav|It is much as it has been described.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_118.wav|Then again, we could have.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_119.wav|It is a delight on every level.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_120.wav|There were no grounds for his action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_121.wav|I was just a child.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_122.wav|We should not be surprised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_123.wav|It was not a finale he would want to remember.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_124.wav|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_125.wav|That period was a struggle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_126.wav|It is too pretty, it is too small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_127.wav|This should begin in October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_128.wav|That is far too high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_129.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_130.wav|It plans to return to this field.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_131.wav|They made such decisions in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_132.wav|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_133.wav|It is a common problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_134.wav|You're a gambling man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_135.wav|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_136.wav|He is a great addition to our team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_137.wav|This is a successful outcome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_138.wav|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_139.wav|Put yourself in the position of being a referee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_140.wav|I think he's the favourite, no question.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_141.wav|I miss the freedom that I had.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_142.wav|It only increased the support for him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_143.wav|Anyone can do the sums.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_144.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_145.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_146.wav|It has become a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_147.wav|The whole industry is a shambles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_148.wav|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_149.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_150.wav|We have a clean bill of health.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_151.wav|It is not normal practice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_152.wav|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_153.wav|He was asked to quit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_154.wav|A new school will be built.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_155.wav|The strong pound also took its toll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_156.wav|It is a terrible tragedy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_157.wav|He was right into football from an early age.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_158.wav|It is not like us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_159.wav|What happened in that game ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_160.wav|Are you going to win ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_161.wav|Was it the wife ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_162.wav|Why change it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_163.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_164.wav|He was in great spirits.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_165.wav|We have a budget in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_166.wav|You've been a great audience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_167.wav|It is simply not true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_168.wav|Well, this article is a bit like that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_169.wav|It is really good news.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_170.wav|We've made a couple of albums.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_171.wav|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_172.wav|My life has been destroyed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_173.wav|I always felt they played for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_174.wav|One season, they might do well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_175.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_176.wav|This much I can tell you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_177.wav|The Hibs manager is no fool.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_178.wav|We are the gateway to justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_179.wav|But one was not enough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_180.wav|I have spoken to head office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_181.wav|I am not ready to walk away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_183.wav|The shooting created panic in the street.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_184.wav|So many people will be affected by this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_185.wav|As many as the market will support.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_186.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_188.wav|This is the time to use it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_189.wav|You know the sort of thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_190.wav|I'm interested in interesting work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_191.wav|We represent a wide range of society.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_192.wav|People will ask about us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_193.wav|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_194.wav|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_195.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_196.wav|I came home by ambulance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_197.wav|I suggest a new plan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_198.wav|It was a moment of madness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_199.wav|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_200.wav|Libya is an easy target.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_201.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_202.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_203.wav|What are you no good at ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_205.wav|Who was she ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_206.wav|It gave no further details.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_207.wav|You've caught a serial killer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_208.wav|I won't make an official complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_209.wav|We are a new department.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_210.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_211.wav|They are looking at flotation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_212.wav|Which isn't a bad idea.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_213.wav|We have an election in eight days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_214.wav|He also presented You Bet!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_215.wav|That might help a bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_216.wav|I had decided to quit the show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_217.wav|He has a lot of skill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_218.wav|I've wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_219.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_220.wav|And the World Cup has not even begun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_221.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_222.wav|That you can do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_223.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_224.wav|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_225.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_226.wav|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_228.wav|We played them off the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_229.wav|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_230.wav|They are the innocent victims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_231.wav|Paterson can afford to be generous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_232.wav|She died in middle age.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_233.wav|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_234.wav|It is set in Paris.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_235.wav|The irony was not lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_236.wav|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_237.wav|Hospitals are for the ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_238.wav|The minister is the engineer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_239.wav|My future is in the marathon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_240.wav|It is now the big brother.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_241.wav|The parties have no contact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_242.wav|She took them for a term.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_243.wav|Nato was not a love affair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_244.wav|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_245.wav|You can feel at home in China.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_246.wav|His is a global perspective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_247.wav|Persuaded to change his mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_248.wav|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_249.wav|This ruling is a farce.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_250.wav|The baby deserves the credit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_251.wav|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_252.wav|But they were never expected to last.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_253.wav|It was a cry for help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_254.wav|No production contract is yet in sight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_255.wav|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_256.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_257.wav|He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_258.wav|It seems a shame to leave it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_259.wav|It was the climax of the thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_260.wav|The concerns are the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_261.wav|I can't get a job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_262.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_263.wav|was everything done to save people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_264.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_265.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_266.wav|Is it in the right place ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_267.wav|Did he trip ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_268.wav|I've had the time of my life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_269.wav|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_270.wav|On the contrary they stand to gain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_271.wav|I thought he might have been a bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_272.wav|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_273.wav|I'd never run for them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_274.wav|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_275.wav|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_276.wav|These figures are truly terrible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_277.wav|Share prices have fallen for three years in a row.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_278.wav|The joint bid is still on course.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_279.wav|At first I thought I was gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_280.wav|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_281.wav|They can leave at any time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_282.wav|That view has not altered.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_283.wav|You get a lot for your money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_284.wav|Blair also had a penalty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_285.wav|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_286.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_288.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_289.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_290.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_291.wav|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_292.wav|I've lost all confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_293.wav|This could be a mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_294.wav|Once again, they would be wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_295.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_296.wav|It's all designed to speed up the service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_297.wav|He will address the nation this evening.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_298.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_299.wav|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_300.wav|But it is up again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_301.wav|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_302.wav|It could well be military.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_303.wav|I was just so determined.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_304.wav|That was the difference between the sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_305.wav|The judge was really nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_307.wav|You are a different people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_308.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_309.wav|He is still in shock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_310.wav|McNaughton was not so sure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_312.wav|I thought it was my only chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_313.wav|I thought he did very well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_314.wav|I'm not making any comment at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_315.wav|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_316.wav|We're on our way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_317.wav|They come to enjoy themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_318.wav|That meant the search was unlawful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_319.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_320.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_322.wav|We want to play at the worlds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_323.wav|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_324.wav|We have got no money to go anywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_325.wav|Have a look at this lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_326.wav|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_327.wav|The king is delighted by the honour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_328.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_329.wav|The problems began a long time ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_330.wav|I am not sure about the rate of progress.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_331.wav|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_332.wav|In the old days, it was easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_333.wav|However, the groups denied the claims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_334.wav|She is now on the back benches.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_336.wav|I think it's about time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_337.wav|The airport was even different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_338.wav|There was no time scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_339.wav|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_340.wav|At first, the youngster was not keen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_341.wav|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_342.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_343.wav|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_344.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_345.wav|Finally came the moment of truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_346.wav|We are encouraged by the news.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_347.wav|What form did that take ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_348.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_349.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_350.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_351.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_352.wav|So what happens next ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_353.wav|The units will not be replaced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_354.wav|Neither man has been charged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_355.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_357.wav|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_358.wav|I am a lucky man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_359.wav|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_360.wav|I've always been a sensitive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_361.wav|Glasgow is a friendly city.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_362.wav|You did not see it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_363.wav|We live on an island.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_364.wav|It is not real life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_365.wav|Neither woman has been named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_366.wav|They should take their mobile phones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_367.wav|You need a licence to run a pub.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_368.wav|We regret that they're brought in the first place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_369.wav|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_370.wav|This is a major championship.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_371.wav|The result is called a patent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_372.wav|But we finished the show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_373.wav|They were to blame for the first two goals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_374.wav|There is no deal as yet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_375.wav|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_376.wav|We were given a break.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_377.wav|In due course the deal was done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_378.wav|to have products for their needs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_379.wav|The pair are very much in love.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_380.wav|We will win the argument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_381.wav|Had this been common practice ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_382.wav|What do they want us to do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_383.wav|Is it worth it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_384.wav|Does it matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_385.wav|You have to rely on each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_386.wav|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_387.wav|I wanted to go out on a high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_388.wav|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_389.wav|That time may never be broken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_390.wav|It was fit for royalty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_391.wav|The response from them was good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_392.wav|There was a substantial explosion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_393.wav|But we are very near.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_394.wav|That's as good as it gets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_395.wav|A review is under way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_396.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_397.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_398.wav|They have failed to deliver.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_399.wav|Clark is back on top form.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_400.wav|I had a fortunate war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_401.wav|She is in their hands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_402.wav|It is a large number.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_403.wav|It does not even have a staff shortage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_404.wav|It is hard to understand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_405.wav|It was a bank holiday, after all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_406.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_407.wav|There was an element of frustration.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_408.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_409.wav|How do you take them away ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_411.wav|After the match, do you ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_412.wav|I will always remember the horrible images.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_414.wav|They are looking for profit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_415.wav|I remain a buyer of the shares.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_416.wav|There is some light in the tunnel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_417.wav|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_418.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_419.wav|The case will now go to appeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_420.wav|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_421.wav|There is a solution, she believes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_422.wav|Yet the data is compelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_423.wav|It was important to win the singles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_424.wav|The road was closed for several hours.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_426.wav|My aim is a top six finish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_427.wav|I would love to think that she could win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_428.wav|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_429.wav|He is on the wrong side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_430.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_431.wav|I was in jail for five years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_432.wav|I never had a childhood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_433.wav|It is based on a true story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_434.wav|But it can be done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_435.wav|I never won a penny throughout my career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_436.wav|There will be no excuses on Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_437.wav|The growth potential is enormous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_438.wav|They are not left wing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_439.wav|The British government does not want to know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_440.wav|They said they were only young men.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_441.wav|We shall not forget him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_442.wav|The people are the hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_443.wav|They made a huge impression on me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_444.wav|It's never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_445.wav|It sounded like a bomb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_446.wav|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_447.wav|We've got a good management record.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_448.wav|Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_449.wav|And we might go back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_450.wav|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_451.wav|We went straight into the bedroom.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_452.wav|Its future is no longer in question.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_453.wav|We put our bid in last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_454.wav|Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_456.wav|They have to be met.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_457.wav|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_458.wav|She has reached the top of her profession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_459.wav|But he has a lifeline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_460.wav|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_461.wav|They were good years for him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_462.wav|Let that be their memorial.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_463.wav|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_464.wav|Driving has been the key.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_465.wav|She has now been registered as disabled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_466.wav|He is well respected by his colleagues.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_467.wav|Classes must be reduced by half.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_468.wav|War is not the action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_469.wav|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_470.wav|It is too early to speculate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_471.wav|Dennis was not so sure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_472.wav|He felt it was the right time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_473.wav|It was clear on Thursday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_474.wav|The casting of her husband was an accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_475.wav|It was all in a short period of time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p231/p231_476.wav|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_025.wav|Johnson was pretty low.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_026.wav|But it failed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_027.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_028.wav|They should be so lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_029.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_030.wav|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_031.wav|It's a matter of balance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_032.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_033.wav|I would love it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_034.wav|It is marvellous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_035.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_036.wav|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_037.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_038.wav|It was fit for royalty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_039.wav|I was scared.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_040.wav|Dancing was her life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_041.wav|I suspect the latter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_042.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_043.wav|But it took a lot of bottle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_044.wav|We will push.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_045.wav|It is urgent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_046.wav|The judge said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_047.wav|It is difficult for Ali.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_048.wav|But it might have done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_049.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_050.wav|They had to explain it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_051.wav|Here's a clue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_052.wav|We were surprised to see the photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_053.wav|It's the big omission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_054.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_055.wav|It's very odd.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_056.wav|Because we do not need it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_057.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_058.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_059.wav|That's the truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_060.wav|That is very hard, alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_061.wav|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_062.wav|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_063.wav|You do not change overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_064.wav|People love to see this stuff.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_065.wav|He was popular.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_066.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_067.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_068.wav|It is like a river running by my home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_069.wav|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_070.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_071.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_072.wav|That was the easy election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_073.wav|There could be a way back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_074.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_075.wav|The price cuts are really exciting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_076.wav|I had my suspicions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_077.wav|It was chaotic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_078.wav|It is a job creation scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_079.wav|He is now resident in England.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_080.wav|I've got the shirt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_081.wav|Today she has been released.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_082.wav|What has changed ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_083.wav|That is bound to happen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_084.wav|I will miss him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_085.wav|It's all going to clear the debt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_086.wav|She had kept the news from him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_087.wav|No progress has been made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_088.wav|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_089.wav|Now the system is right behind us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_090.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_091.wav|It is a lifeline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_092.wav|Today I couldn't run on it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_093.wav|However, it did not end that way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_094.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_095.wav|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_096.wav|Then came the crunch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_097.wav|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_098.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_099.wav|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_100.wav|It was mayhem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_101.wav|They were outside the circle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_102.wav|It was a good performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_103.wav|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_104.wav|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_105.wav|That is no use.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_106.wav|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_107.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_108.wav|He pleaded for caution.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_109.wav|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_110.wav|I don't have many friends.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_111.wav|He was jailed for a year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_112.wav|You had better believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_113.wav|It's not fair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_114.wav|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_115.wav|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_116.wav|Maybe this battle has been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_117.wav|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_118.wav|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_119.wav|This is the end of a chapter, and this is very sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_120.wav|It is rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_121.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_122.wav|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_123.wav|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_124.wav|That's all right then.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_125.wav|I'm so angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_126.wav|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_127.wav|It has removed a bit of guilt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_128.wav|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_129.wav|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_130.wav|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_131.wav|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_132.wav|I am now unemployed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_133.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_134.wav|You've got to be vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_135.wav|Our intentions are real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_136.wav|They took a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_137.wav|The goals were good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_138.wav|What will happen then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_139.wav|I am totally devoted to this job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_140.wav|He is severe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_141.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_142.wav|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_143.wav|They did very well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_144.wav|The home side didn't stand a chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_145.wav|We want to see the maximum of change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_146.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_147.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_148.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_149.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_150.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_151.wav|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_152.wav|It was by the numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_153.wav|I was in daily contact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_154.wav|They were later discharged from hospital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_155.wav|This latter point is hugely important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_156.wav|It is an attitude of mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_158.wav|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_159.wav|We have to move forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_160.wav|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_161.wav|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_162.wav|Tell it like it was ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_163.wav|It is not too late to get on board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_164.wav|That must be left to the Parole Board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_165.wav|Again, we were lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_166.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_167.wav|Waiting times for these services are too long.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_168.wav|That will do for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_169.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_170.wav|We've made a couple of albums.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_171.wav|My life has been destroyed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_172.wav|They thought they had found a home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_173.wav|It became a book by itself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_174.wav|I always felt they played for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_175.wav|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_176.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_177.wav|Blair's response was weak.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_178.wav|It's the real thing, for sure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_179.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_180.wav|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_181.wav|The clarity is vital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_182.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_183.wav|Everyone can be bought.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_184.wav|A career as a doctor is on hold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_185.wav|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_186.wav|It is the whole package.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_187.wav|I've been there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_188.wav|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_189.wav|They receive a high profile in the media.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_190.wav|We did everything by the book.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_191.wav|I wish I could say something.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_192.wav|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_193.wav|The procedure is the same in all cases.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_194.wav|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_195.wav|I wanted to put myself on the line.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_196.wav|I came home by ambulance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_197.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_198.wav|The conference is the first test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_199.wav|The service from the other players was super.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_200.wav|He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_201.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_202.wav|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_203.wav|A deadline is still essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_204.wav|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_205.wav|It's a mixture of everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_206.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_207.wav|I don't want to use it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_208.wav|Now, it's all right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_209.wav|There was an e-mail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_210.wav|That's the day job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_211.wav|Feel the heat ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_212.wav|He knows a lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_213.wav|He is slightly confused.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_214.wav|She should not be blamed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_215.wav|His third goal was superb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_216.wav|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_217.wav|It's not ideal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_218.wav|He seemed to lose his focus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_219.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_220.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_221.wav|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_223.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_224.wav|That has been the easy part.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_225.wav|We've got the bronze.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_226.wav|Mental health is a massive issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_227.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_228.wav|It was good fun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_229.wav|What was the main difference ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_230.wav|I am immensely sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_231.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_232.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_233.wav|The track is currently covered in snow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_234.wav|But she was.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_235.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_236.wav|We were awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_237.wav|However, no further action was taken by police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_238.wav|And thought we would get away with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_239.wav|It is set in Paris.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_240.wav|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_241.wav|It's quite nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_242.wav|It's quite a line-up!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_243.wav|It's a lovely, lovely film.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_244.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_245.wav|Broke the birdie record.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_246.wav|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_247.wav|She is well balanced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_248.wav|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_249.wav|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_250.wav|He says that he is no different from any other man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_251.wav|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_252.wav|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_253.wav|I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_254.wav|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_255.wav|It's a record label, not a form of music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_256.wav|A friendship that will endure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_257.wav|I can't get a job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_258.wav|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_259.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_260.wav|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_261.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_262.wav|It does not appear at this stage that alcohol was a factor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_263.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_264.wav|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_265.wav|Blood samples were taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_266.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_267.wav|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_268.wav|Of course, that is not the whole story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_269.wav|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_270.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_271.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_272.wav|He is a young man with a new deal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_273.wav|He was also married with two children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_274.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_275.wav|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_276.wav|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_277.wav|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_278.wav|They wanted the club to make money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_279.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_280.wav|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_281.wav|It's a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_282.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_283.wav|I am an estate agent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_284.wav|The record companies have gone through the floor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_285.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_286.wav|It was a privilege to work for him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_287.wav|It happens from time to time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_288.wav|He looked very sharp.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_289.wav|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_290.wav|I saw it at a ruck.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_291.wav|They were also beside themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_292.wav|The attacker died in the crash.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_293.wav|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_294.wav|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_295.wav|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_296.wav|He was obviously very genuine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_297.wav|These figures are truly awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_298.wav|He should have won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_299.wav|He has retired.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_300.wav|What has altered ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_301.wav|I thought it was my only chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_302.wav|Nothing is safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_303.wav|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_305.wav|They are wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_306.wav|It is a road of death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_307.wav|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_308.wav|We are in the end game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_309.wav|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_310.wav|He was solid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_311.wav|Special measures were needed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_312.wav|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_313.wav|I never thought it would take this long.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_314.wav|We are a peaceful people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_315.wav|Kids are terrible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_316.wav|It should be equal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_317.wav|Craig is a major concern for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_318.wav|The home team had an amazing start.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_319.wav|For the moment, our position remains the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_320.wav|Referees are easy targets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_321.wav|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_322.wav|However, the groups denied the claims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_323.wav|I came into this world with nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_324.wav|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_325.wav|Off with their heads.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_326.wav|It's not long enough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_327.wav|My view has now completely changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_328.wav|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_329.wav|We agreed to disagree.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_330.wav|It could have gone either way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_331.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_332.wav|Horses are drawn by ballot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_333.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_334.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_335.wav|She did not attend the courtroom.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_336.wav|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_337.wav|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_338.wav|The team for the first game could be this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_339.wav|They haven't got a hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_340.wav|Who will do it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_341.wav|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_342.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_343.wav|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_344.wav|He has to learn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_345.wav|Indeed, it was magical.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_346.wav|Tiger is the exception.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_347.wav|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_348.wav|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_349.wav|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_350.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_351.wav|Everything was an effort.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_352.wav|The boat was fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_353.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_354.wav|It is long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_355.wav|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_356.wav|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_357.wav|He had played well in that central role.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_358.wav|It's not that clear-cut.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_359.wav|She is free.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_360.wav|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_361.wav|I kept going for her.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_362.wav|You must have a government and a good civil service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_363.wav|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_364.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_365.wav|However, it was well worth the wait.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_366.wav|It benefits the whole family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_367.wav|He has seen the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_368.wav|It was one in the afternoon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_369.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_370.wav|We will be homeless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_371.wav|The scene is about this ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_372.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_373.wav|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_374.wav|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_375.wav|It was a double tragedy for the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_376.wav|He could make it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_377.wav|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_378.wav|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_379.wav|They have not done so this season so far.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_380.wav|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_381.wav|Well, the big day has arrived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_382.wav|Five members were disciplined.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_383.wav|Talks are progressing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_384.wav|There is no signature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_385.wav|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_386.wav|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_387.wav|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_388.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_389.wav|It has moved on in the last week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_390.wav|That's the name of the game, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_391.wav|You thought it was a headache.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_392.wav|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_393.wav|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_394.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_395.wav|We're looking for justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_396.wav|I can lead by example.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_397.wav|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_398.wav|But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_399.wav|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_400.wav|It will probably take me just days to spend it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_401.wav|It is legally binding.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_402.wav|We knew nothing about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_403.wav|My house was shaking at the time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_404.wav|This is a huge confidence boost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_405.wav|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_406.wav|He was a crazy man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_407.wav|We should have known.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_408.wav|Feel the air, the space.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_409.wav|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_410.wav|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_411.wav|You wanted the evidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_412.wav|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_413.wav|It was that bad, that low.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_414.wav|I was very young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p232/p232_415.wav|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_025.wav|We are a service industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_026.wav|But we will have to wait.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_027.wav|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_028.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_029.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_030.wav|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_032.wav|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_033.wav|This is a central issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_037.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_038.wav|Victory was never in doubt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_039.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_040.wav|We are the party of the future.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_041.wav|I have never been a member of the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_042.wav|He was in his element.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_043.wav|That means an extra two years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_044.wav|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_045.wav|All businesses continue to trade.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_046.wav|The man became a reporter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_047.wav|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_048.wav|It is all starting to come together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_049.wav|Part of the complex is historic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_050.wav|The strategy is not without risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_051.wav|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_052.wav|I was released after six days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_053.wav|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_054.wav|We are working on it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_055.wav|I've never been one for complaining about the press.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_056.wav|This trend is likely to strengthen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_057.wav|Still, he did not let himself down this week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_058.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_059.wav|There was no safety net.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_060.wav|He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_061.wav|You have to be patient.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_062.wav|That is all in the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_063.wav|That could be a mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_064.wav|It was an amazing result.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_065.wav|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_066.wav|He has not been dropped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_067.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_068.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_070.wav|This time, it might be for real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_071.wav|She did that for the rest of her life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_072.wav|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_073.wav|It starts with the script.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_074.wav|We were under a bit of pressure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_075.wav|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_076.wav|We can all make a mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_077.wav|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_079.wav|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_080.wav|On the night, it was not enough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_081.wav|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_082.wav|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_083.wav|They were badly prepared for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_084.wav|It is not a story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_085.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_086.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_087.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_088.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_089.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_090.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_091.wav|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_092.wav|They have a further report to make in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_093.wav|He is in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_094.wav|The Festival is prepared to help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_095.wav|By then, he was walking on water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_096.wav|I had a bit in hand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_097.wav|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_098.wav|I cannot wait to get started on it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_099.wav|That is the fact of the matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_100.wav|It should be a condition of employment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_101.wav|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_102.wav|It is much as it has been described.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_103.wav|Police said the family was helping with the search.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_104.wav|She was there for the start of the campaign.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_105.wav|He has become a monster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_106.wav|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_107.wav|Everyone had to play the game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_108.wav|In London today, it was business as usual.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_109.wav|It is not affected by the sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_110.wav|We are currently working on the details.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_111.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_112.wav|I thought it was a fantastic game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_113.wav|The picture is the same across Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_114.wav|It was the eighties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_115.wav|We do not expect any surplus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_116.wav|You had better believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_117.wav|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_118.wav|It's not a new concept in jazz.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_119.wav|My office is bare.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_120.wav|I'm delighted about that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_121.wav|I joined a group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_122.wav|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_123.wav|Who would be a referee?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_125.wav|That's all right then.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_126.wav|There were no grounds for his action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_127.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_128.wav|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_129.wav|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_130.wav|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_131.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_132.wav|He's been the key to everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_133.wav|It's an amazing landscape!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_134.wav|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_135.wav|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_136.wav|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_137.wav|I am now unemployed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_138.wav|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_139.wav|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_140.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_141.wav|Mr Hall is believed to have broken a leg.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_142.wav|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_143.wav|Is that it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_144.wav|I saw some terrible things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_146.wav|It seems so long since I did the exams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_147.wav|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_148.wav|Who would be right ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_149.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_150.wav|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_151.wav|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_152.wav|It is like a football team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_153.wav|It would be a last resort.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_154.wav|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_155.wav|He will emerge as a world leader.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_156.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_157.wav|The home side didn't stand a chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_158.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_159.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_160.wav|I was so nervous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_161.wav|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_162.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_163.wav|It is not normal practice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_164.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_165.wav|The attacker has been put in foster care.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_166.wav|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_167.wav|Neither side can win this war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_168.wav|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_169.wav|It is so unfair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_170.wav|I will tell you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_171.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_172.wav|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_173.wav|I have got a wife to feed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_174.wav|It's that sort of night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_175.wav|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_176.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_177.wav|The release attracted little attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_178.wav|Waiting times for these services are too long.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_179.wav|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_180.wav|We've made a couple of albums.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_181.wav|They thought they had found a home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_182.wav|He will feel the pain again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_183.wav|I always felt they played for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_184.wav|Is Saddam a threat ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_185.wav|I feel like my game has come a long way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_186.wav|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_187.wav|If that's the case, he will struggle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_188.wav|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_189.wav|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_190.wav|I was totally wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_191.wav|There is no point in looking any further.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_192.wav|I've been there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_193.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_194.wav|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_195.wav|It's a joke.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_196.wav|I had a train to catch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_197.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_198.wav|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_199.wav|However, this idea is never developed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_200.wav|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_201.wav|He may need it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_203.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_204.wav|It wasn't to be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_208.wav|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_209.wav|I have a cold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_210.wav|He had suffered a heart attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_211.wav|A deadline is still essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_212.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_213.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_214.wav|That will be vital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_215.wav|We need to handle it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_216.wav|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_217.wav|I had relied on him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_218.wav|His third goal was superb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_220.wav|In each case they were a goal down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_221.wav|The FBI could become involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_222.wav|Work has started.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_223.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_224.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_225.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_226.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_228.wav|Mental health is a massive issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_229.wav|You have to do your research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_230.wav|We played them off the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_231.wav|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_232.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_233.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_234.wav|My neighbours are horrified.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_235.wav|But he failed to win the committee's support.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_236.wav|I can't wait to meet him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_237.wav|Broke the birdie record.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_238.wav|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_239.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_240.wav|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_241.wav|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_242.wav|We were extremely poor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_243.wav|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_244.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_245.wav|I know I'm in a very special position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_246.wav|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_247.wav|The salary changes are long overdue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_248.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_249.wav|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_250.wav|There wasn't a goal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_251.wav|It was a cry for help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_252.wav|A friendship that will endure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_253.wav|This year I understood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_254.wav|Her presence was almost everywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_255.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_256.wav|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_257.wav|I watched a game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_258.wav|There will be tough opponents to this report.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_259.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_260.wav|I was happily surprised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_261.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_262.wav|It is also very valuable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_263.wav|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_264.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_265.wav|It is not just about pay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_266.wav|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_267.wav|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_268.wav|Blood samples were taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_269.wav|They are never here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_270.wav|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_271.wav|It looks as though he will be right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_272.wav|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_273.wav|Immediate action must be taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_274.wav|He is a young man with a new deal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_275.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_276.wav|It is the same in Sweden.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_277.wav|And Michael was just great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_278.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_279.wav|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_280.wav|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_281.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_282.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_283.wav|I feel pretty good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_284.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_285.wav|It was a privilege to work for him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_286.wav|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_288.wav|They were too hard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_289.wav|He looked very sharp.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_290.wav|All options are open.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_291.wav|The attacker died in the crash.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_292.wav|It was a virus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_294.wav|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_295.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_296.wav|Sunday's game was not a trial.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_297.wav|Who can predict ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_298.wav|This is a huge confidence boost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_299.wav|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_300.wav|We have to sort it out ourselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_301.wav|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_302.wav|I thought it was my only chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_303.wav|One was a lawyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_304.wav|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_305.wav|They should be swept away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_306.wav|This is a war over our home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_307.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_308.wav|I was in daily contact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_309.wav|We want to play at the worlds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_310.wav|This is the culture change in medicine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_311.wav|Is there on his hands ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_312.wav|We have got no money to go anywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_313.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_314.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_315.wav|The problems began a long time ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_316.wav|My body is clearly capable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_317.wav|We are very strongly behind the bid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_319.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_320.wav|My view has now completely changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_321.wav|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_322.wav|We agreed to disagree.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_323.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_324.wav|I saw some good things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_325.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_326.wav|Robert is a special talent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_327.wav|It added to the spectacle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_328.wav|Who was the mystery MP ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_329.wav|He told the court.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_330.wav|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_331.wav|Who will do it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_332.wav|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_333.wav|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_334.wav|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_335.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_336.wav|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_337.wav|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_338.wav|Nobody else was with me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_339.wav|I've learned from my mistakes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_340.wav|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_341.wav|The composer will conduct.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_342.wav|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_343.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_344.wav|His contract was then not renewed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_345.wav|Eight months later, he was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_346.wav|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_347.wav|He had played well in that central role.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_348.wav|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_349.wav|Tyson is overwhelmed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_350.wav|However, it was well worth the wait.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_351.wav|He agreed with my proposal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_352.wav|Hartley should know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_353.wav|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_354.wav|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_355.wav|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_356.wav|Also, it is the season of goodwill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_357.wav|Equity declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_358.wav|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_359.wav|He could make it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_360.wav|The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_361.wav|They have not done so this season so far.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_362.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_363.wav|Safety was also an issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_364.wav|They received a reply from their own managers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_365.wav|But I managed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_366.wav|They play together perfectly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_367.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_368.wav|Colour was at the core of his life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_369.wav|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_370.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_371.wav|We shall not be moved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_373.wav|It was a hit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_374.wav|He's a nice guy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_375.wav|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_376.wav|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_377.wav|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_378.wav|The mood was defiant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_379.wav|Yet the data is compelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_381.wav|It's just outrageous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_382.wav|The road was closed for several hours.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_383.wav|It is unusual.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_384.wav|That will come after the game on Saturday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_385.wav|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_386.wav|That set the tone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_387.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_388.wav|I was in jail for five years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_389.wav|What happened in the summer ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_390.wav|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_391.wav|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p233/p233_392.wav|He has not created a Festival resource.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_025.wav|We are a service industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_026.wav|But we will have to wait.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_027.wav|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_028.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_029.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_030.wav|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_031.wav|It is on the internet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_032.wav|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_033.wav|This is a central issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_034.wav|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_035.wav|History is in the making.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_036.wav|It was sold at a loss.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_037.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_038.wav|Victory was never in doubt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_039.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_040.wav|We are the party of the future.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_041.wav|I have never been a member of the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_042.wav|He was in his element.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_043.wav|That means an extra two years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_044.wav|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_045.wav|All businesses continue to trade.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_046.wav|The man became a reporter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_047.wav|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_048.wav|It is all starting to come together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_049.wav|Part of the complex is historic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_050.wav|The strategy is not without risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_051.wav|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_052.wav|I was released after six days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_053.wav|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_054.wav|We are working on it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_055.wav|I've never been one for complaining about the press.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_056.wav|This trend is likely to strengthen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_057.wav|Still, he did not let himself down this week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_058.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_059.wav|There was no safety net.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_060.wav|He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_061.wav|You have to be patient.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_062.wav|That is all in the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_063.wav|That could be a mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_064.wav|It was an amazing result.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_065.wav|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_066.wav|He has not been dropped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_067.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_068.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_069.wav|The market is appalling for initial public offerings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_070.wav|This time, it might be for real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_071.wav|She did that for the rest of her life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_072.wav|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_073.wav|It starts with the script.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_074.wav|We were under a bit of pressure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_075.wav|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_076.wav|We can all make a mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_077.wav|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_079.wav|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_080.wav|On the night, it was not enough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_081.wav|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_082.wav|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_083.wav|They were badly prepared for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_084.wav|It is not a story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_085.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_086.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_087.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_088.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_089.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_090.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_091.wav|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_092.wav|They have a further report to make in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_093.wav|He is in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_094.wav|The Festival is prepared to help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_095.wav|By then, he was walking on water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_096.wav|I had a bit in hand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_097.wav|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_098.wav|I cannot wait to get started on it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_099.wav|That is the fact of the matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_100.wav|It should be a condition of employment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_101.wav|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_102.wav|It is much as it has been described.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_103.wav|Police said the family was helping with the search.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_104.wav|She was there for the start of the campaign.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_105.wav|He has become a monster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_106.wav|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_107.wav|Everyone had to play the game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_108.wav|In London today, it was business as usual.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_109.wav|It is not affected by the sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_110.wav|We are currently working on the details.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_111.wav|That would be decided at the interim results in November, he added.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_112.wav|That would be a serious problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_113.wav|Our action is not the end, but the beginning of a process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_114.wav|People have been placed in a state of alarm.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_115.wav|She is not a victim.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_116.wav|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_117.wav|And we had a good response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_118.wav|When we looked at the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_119.wav|No, the equipment is extra.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_120.wav|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_121.wav|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_122.wav|That admission is not surprising.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_123.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_124.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_125.wav|There was a lot of resentment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_126.wav|He wanted to record the group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_127.wav|However, it was a different story in the final.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_128.wav|The end result is the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_129.wav|Three days later, he was killed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_130.wav|We are committed to the ban.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_131.wav|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_132.wav|The problem was a social problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_133.wav|He had no money left to run the club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_134.wav|It is not so simple.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_135.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_136.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_137.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_138.wav|And does it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_139.wav|Are you from the rugby ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_140.wav|Actors like to be in the centre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_141.wav|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_142.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_143.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_144.wav|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_145.wav|I can't even get into the A team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_146.wav|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_147.wav|She does not want to speak.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_148.wav|It is expected to last a week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_149.wav|Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_150.wav|It is too pretty, it is too small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_151.wav|As for the warning, it was not needed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_152.wav|But it is different in different regions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_153.wav|That is the nature of the game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_154.wav|There is a spring in the step.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_155.wav|We want to get there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_156.wav|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_157.wav|I have a lot of confidence in this team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_158.wav|The players were under pressure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_159.wav|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_160.wav|There is no common ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_161.wav|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_162.wav|In that case, the children were not missing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_163.wav|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_164.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_165.wav|Anyone can do the sums.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_166.wav|At the moment we do not understand it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_167.wav|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_168.wav|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_169.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_170.wav|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_171.wav|Much of the equipment was new.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_172.wav|I have had a good life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_173.wav|Three hours later, the man was free.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_174.wav|That was the difference between the sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_175.wav|They have not been named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_176.wav|I was in a hole.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_177.wav|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_178.wav|I was always in control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_179.wav|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_180.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_181.wav|He was asked to quit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_182.wav|There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_183.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_184.wav|They were not seeking the right to strike.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_185.wav|He called for a public inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_186.wav|Tony Blair has had a good conference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_187.wav|As, indeed, they would be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_188.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_189.wav|It is simply not true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_190.wav|In light of things, I think I made the right decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_191.wav|It is not in the public interest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_192.wav|Well, this article is a bit like that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_193.wav|The performance is not there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_194.wav|It would make a lot of sense.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_195.wav|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_196.wav|Clearly, they had other problems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_197.wav|He has defended the system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_198.wav|If that's the case, he will struggle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_199.wav|I could not sit in the stands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_200.wav|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_201.wav|They have to get that sorted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_202.wav|Yet the performance was not entirely convincing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_203.wav|We can take the city.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_204.wav|Are you going to win ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_205.wav|Was it the wife ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_207.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_208.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_209.wav|I will be in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_210.wav|It was the story of the second half.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_211.wav|The trading conditions are not good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_212.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_213.wav|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_214.wav|This is an interesting link.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_216.wav|It was a management problem in the hospital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_217.wav|Being investor ready is a good start.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_218.wav|Last night, the company could not be contacted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_219.wav|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_220.wav|This conference was never confirmed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_221.wav|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_222.wav|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_223.wav|He must have a crack at it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_224.wav|The force is with them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_225.wav|Her experience is certainly limited.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_226.wav|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_227.wav|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_228.wav|Mr Blair was ready for him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_229.wav|We are waiting for the Minister to come back with an answer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_230.wav|He intends to restart in the spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_231.wav|He is a good friend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_232.wav|It is the strength of the school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_233.wav|But it may not be all bad news.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_234.wav|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_235.wav|The conference is the first test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_236.wav|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_237.wav|But we are not immune to the problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_238.wav|I was not overly concerned about this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_239.wav|However, it is not as simple as this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_240.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_241.wav|A deadline is still essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_242.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_243.wav|Was everything done to save people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_244.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_245.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_246.wav|Is it in the right place ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_247.wav|Did he trip ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_248.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_249.wav|You can buy them over the counter, anywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_250.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_251.wav|We have an election in eight days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_252.wav|It was far from business as usual.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_253.wav|It was just another play.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_254.wav|From there, they can go anywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_255.wav|The world is a good place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_256.wav|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_257.wav|The matter is under appeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_258.wav|I am delighted for them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_259.wav|It was a great experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_260.wav|They are difficult awards to decide.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_261.wav|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_262.wav|His second was a beauty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_263.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_264.wav|Scotland played a major part in the project.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_265.wav|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_266.wav|Not in this production he doesn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_267.wav|We can certainly build on this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_268.wav|Then was the summer of their discontent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_269.wav|There is a world of difference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_270.wav|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_271.wav|Well, it was certainly different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_272.wav|We want this place to work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_273.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_274.wav|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_275.wav|The statement contained no surprises.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_276.wav|The performance continues to improve.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_277.wav|That would be a danger.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_278.wav|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_279.wav|However, no further action was taken by police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_280.wav|It depends on Labour, not on us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_281.wav|I had to be into it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_282.wav|My view has always been the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_283.wav|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_284.wav|It is set in Paris.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_285.wav|Do you think we're a top nation ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_286.wav|Is our children learning ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_287.wav|How independent is that ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_288.wav|What form did that take ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_289.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_290.wav|The party has never fully recovered.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_291.wav|In many ways, that is as important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_292.wav|His leader wanted to celebrate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_293.wav|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_294.wav|Of further privacy, he had no need.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_295.wav|He was good, but not that good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_296.wav|The results are expected within days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_297.wav|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_298.wav|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_299.wav|We were well worth the win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_300.wav|And it was this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_301.wav|But that's another story for another day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_302.wav|But it was also hard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_303.wav|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_304.wav|We're looking for unity in the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_305.wav|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_306.wav|They are not going the length of the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_307.wav|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_308.wav|The concerns are the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_309.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_310.wav|Scotland won by six wickets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_311.wav|It has to be enforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_312.wav|And we can do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_313.wav|Every one is a winner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_314.wav|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_315.wav|They have set the standard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_316.wav|This is a major property in Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_317.wav|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_318.wav|The existing structure is in trouble.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_319.wav|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_320.wav|He refused to reveal the reasons for the split.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_321.wav|You have to count on other people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_322.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_323.wav|And he's the real thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_324.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_325.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_326.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_327.wav|But it is important for a number of reasons.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_328.wav|All of the management has invested in the firm.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_329.wav|The family is not interested in the value of the house.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_330.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_331.wav|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_332.wav|But it can be done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_333.wav|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_334.wav|We have to be very, very careful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_335.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_336.wav|This could be a mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_337.wav|Hopefully, this week will be good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_338.wav|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_339.wav|I think the overall picture is still strong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_340.wav|That is always a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_341.wav|We will deliver at director level.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_342.wav|We did something about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_343.wav|The market is the market.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_344.wav|We do not have the papers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_345.wav|However, the devil is in the detail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_346.wav|For the moment, however, the position is clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_347.wav|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_348.wav|The answer was in space.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_349.wav|We are not interested in dividends.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_350.wav|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_351.wav|His concern is only for the future.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_352.wav|And it's a goodbye from him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_353.wav|They have to be addressed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_354.wav|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_355.wav|However, a bid was never made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_356.wav|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_357.wav|The City welcomed the numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_358.wav|Something is going to have to give.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_359.wav|There's still a bit to go.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_360.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p234/p234_361.wav|We never played at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_025.wav|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_026.wav|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_027.wav|Meetings will also remain private.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_028.wav|Because we do not need it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_029.wav|It's going to have a hell of an effect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_030.wav|And we have a singer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_031.wav|He was jailed for four years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_032.wav|He should emerge as the winner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_033.wav|This is a central issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_034.wav|He works at the airport.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_035.wav|It is not for any other purpose.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_036.wav|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_037.wav|It carried a double message.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_038.wav|That means an extra two years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_039.wav|That was the case with David.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_040.wav|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_041.wav|I needed a change, a new challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_042.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_043.wav|Their campaign is in disarray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_044.wav|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_045.wav|We are working on it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_046.wav|He looks like an Afghan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_047.wav|Everything else is a bonus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_048.wav|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_049.wav|This is the interesting part.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_050.wav|I haven't been ill at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_051.wav|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_052.wav|That was the difference today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_053.wav|We keep an eye on it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_054.wav|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_055.wav|We felt it was sufficient.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_056.wav|You must have a government and a good civil service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_057.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_058.wav|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_059.wav|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_060.wav|I have proved that in the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_061.wav|The tournament has now been cancelled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_062.wav|I was very pleased with them today, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_063.wav|I was as strong as a horse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_064.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_065.wav|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_066.wav|Both men were on one-year contracts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_068.wav|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_069.wav|It is a job creation scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_070.wav|He was seen as the enemy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_071.wav|It looks like a hit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_072.wav|These people are not big names.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_073.wav|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_074.wav|We did it for the jersey.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_075.wav|The Festival is prepared to help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_076.wav|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_077.wav|By then, he was walking on water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_078.wav|He was just a journalist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_079.wav|On Saturday, it was much the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_080.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_081.wav|We have turned the corner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_083.wav|The Queen Mother is dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_084.wav|However, the approach is not believed to be hostile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_085.wav|Change will however have to be in euros.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_086.wav|It was a big departure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_087.wav|Does it matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_088.wav|How do you take them away ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_089.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_090.wav|After the match, do you ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_091.wav|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_092.wav|The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_093.wav|It is open season on the Old Firm.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_094.wav|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_095.wav|I had a ball today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_096.wav|He refused to name the survivors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_097.wav|That time is not now, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_098.wav|We created so many chances.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_099.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_100.wav|Our house was very small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_101.wav|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_102.wav|It became difficult for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_103.wav|It's not a lack of effort.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_104.wav|It is a total and utter change of culture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_105.wav|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_107.wav|They will notice a difference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_108.wav|Football is a passion for many.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_109.wav|New Year will be very busy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_110.wav|There's still plenty time left.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_111.wav|The result is a vacuum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_112.wav|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_113.wav|You can spend money on housing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_114.wav|The hearing was due to continue today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_115.wav|I can't even get into the A team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_116.wav|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_117.wav|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_118.wav|Three hours later, the man was free.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_119.wav|Which can happen any time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_120.wav|The colours are very pretty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_121.wav|He is a lovely man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_122.wav|Becoming a father was wonderful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_123.wav|I was on a roll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_124.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_125.wav|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_126.wav|He said to give a local injection.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_127.wav|They made such decisions in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_128.wav|You are a gambling man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_129.wav|Before it was an ordeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_130.wav|I love the spectacle of cinema.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_131.wav|We will try to find someone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_132.wav|They could use a boost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_133.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_134.wav|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_135.wav|I enjoy the creative process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_136.wav|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_137.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_138.wav|It was a piece of art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_139.wav|That view has not altered.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_140.wav|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_141.wav|So I got a blood test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_142.wav|It has become a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_143.wav|The whole industry is a shambles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_144.wav|Like the others, he was arrested.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_145.wav|We will provide immediate access.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_146.wav|He could do nothing about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_147.wav|We have a clean bill of health.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_148.wav|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_149.wav|I was shaking on the blocks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_151.wav|It was by the numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_152.wav|It would seem a natural progression.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_153.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_154.wav|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_155.wav|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_156.wav|It was a funny feeling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_157.wav|I'm afraid to say anything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_158.wav|We did what we had to do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_159.wav|It's not like us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_161.wav|It is not a financial issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_162.wav|I have got a wife to feed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_163.wav|Seven people were later detained by police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_164.wav|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_165.wav|We have a budget in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_166.wav|He is not a team captain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_167.wav|Greenwood said he was happy with that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_168.wav|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_169.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_170.wav|That is not the case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_172.wav|It's nice to be nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_173.wav|They could not match it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_174.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_175.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_176.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_177.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_178.wav|So what happens next ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_179.wav|Had this been common practice ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_180.wav|What do they want us to do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_181.wav|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_182.wav|One season, they might do well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_183.wav|I feel like my game has come a long way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_184.wav|The Hibs manager is no fool.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_185.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_186.wav|City sentiment is in his favour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_187.wav|The hotel was now for sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_188.wav|We are the gateway to justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_189.wav|Tomorrow is a new day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_190.wav|It makes no influence on the public.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_191.wav|Each case is treated on merit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_192.wav|I have spoken to head office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_193.wav|Says the Duke of York.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_194.wav|I had too much to drink.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_195.wav|As many as the market will support.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_196.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_197.wav|That is a waste of energy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_198.wav|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_199.wav|It could be argued that the council was pushed to the brink.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_200.wav|I had a train to catch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_201.wav|It shows the strength of the roots.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_202.wav|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_203.wav|This youngster is so exciting!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_204.wav|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_205.wav|It caused a lot of upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_206.wav|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_207.wav|My duty is to win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_208.wav|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_209.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_210.wav|No details of the talks were given.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_211.wav|This will be our new beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_212.wav|They have the cash and the fire power.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_213.wav|The service from the other players was super.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_214.wav|The early physical reports were clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_215.wav|Tommy is not a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_216.wav|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_217.wav|John Daly has a burning ambition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_218.wav|A deadline is still essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_219.wav|You have caught a serial killer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_220.wav|You are a great player.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_221.wav|I won't make an official complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_222.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_223.wav|They are looking at a flotation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_224.wav|Which isn't a bad idea.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_225.wav|There is no quick fix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_226.wav|There was a lot of resentment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_227.wav|That might help a bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_228.wav|From there, they can go anywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_229.wav|Death is outside the language.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_230.wav|I had relied on him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_231.wav|The course has helped a lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_232.wav|I'm just a regular person.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_233.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_234.wav|His third goal was superb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_235.wav|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_236.wav|I am considered a teenager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_237.wav|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_238.wav|This will secure the future of our industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_239.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_240.wav|People should make their own decisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_241.wav|They said that they stood by their statement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_242.wav|You have to do your research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_243.wav|We played them off the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_244.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_245.wav|Truth is the child of time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_246.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_247.wav|Was everything done to save people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_249.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_250.wav|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_251.wav|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_252.wav|It's important to get it right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_253.wav|Pensions are a long-term investment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_254.wav|Those overseas offices were great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_255.wav|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_256.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_257.wav|I was just a kid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_258.wav|He was good, but not that good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_259.wav|It was quite a new prescription.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_260.wav|It is very hard for her.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_261.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_262.wav|It is believed the size of the settlement has not been finalised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_263.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_264.wav|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_265.wav|You can feel at home in China.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_266.wav|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_267.wav|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_268.wav|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_269.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_270.wav|But they were never expected to last.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_271.wav|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_272.wav|The capital costs are modest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_273.wav|I told you I was ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_274.wav|He will go on the bench.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_275.wav|That could be in place by next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_276.wav|We accept the new rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_277.wav|We run within the law.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_278.wav|We have the moral high ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_279.wav|He took over our lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_280.wav|It has all been done in secret.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_281.wav|They must play for each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_282.wav|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_283.wav|She always wanted her own way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_284.wav|I realised I was lucky to have it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_285.wav|They can leave at any time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_286.wav|Much of the equipment was new.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_287.wav|Blair also had a penalty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_288.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_289.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_290.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_291.wav|My body is a wreck.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_292.wav|She failed in her action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_293.wav|Stephen will get his first cap.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_294.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_295.wav|And that match was played in June.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_296.wav|I saw it at a ruck.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_297.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_298.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_299.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_300.wav|What are you not good at ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_301.wav|I think, therefore I am ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_302.wav|It's all designed to speed up the service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_303.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_304.wav|He will address the nation this evening.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_305.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_306.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_307.wav|The rescue package is public money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_308.wav|I was there five months ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_309.wav|I am a retailer by nature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_310.wav|His job was not advertised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_311.wav|We can work all night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_312.wav|It was really very frightening.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_313.wav|It was an excellent performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_314.wav|The answer is with ourselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_315.wav|And we can do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_316.wav|These figures are truly awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_317.wav|That is the real test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_318.wav|They have to be addressed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_319.wav|It aims to produce its report before Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_320.wav|Cast Away now on general release.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_321.wav|All winners should be tested.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_322.wav|I can live with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_323.wav|A lot has been written.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_324.wav|And he goes with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_325.wav|The law will take its course.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_326.wav|This is a historic occasion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_327.wav|This ruling is a farce.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_328.wav|After some discussion they did.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_329.wav|I am not obsessed with sex.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_330.wav|I didn't have the reply.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_331.wav|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_332.wav|These days will be back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_333.wav|You may have a short memory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_335.wav|There was no time scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_336.wav|That decision has already been made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_337.wav|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_338.wav|The game is now open.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_339.wav|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_340.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_341.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_342.wav|It was almost too much.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_343.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_344.wav|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_345.wav|Three years ago he would have been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_346.wav|It's a policy which has worked for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_347.wav|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_348.wav|The confidence isn't there now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_349.wav|We put our bid in last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_350.wav|A great deal has been achieved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_351.wav|He had no previous convictions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_352.wav|Alex Ferguson is the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_353.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_354.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_355.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_356.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_357.wav|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_358.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_359.wav|Scotland is the home of golf.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_360.wav|They have broken that promise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_361.wav|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_362.wav|It's only a matter of scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_363.wav|We must put a marker down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_364.wav|She said they would appeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_365.wav|There is no deal as yet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_366.wav|It's as wide as a church in here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_367.wav|The work with Alison was a great experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_368.wav|It was like a weekly wage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_369.wav|We are a Scottish company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_370.wav|They will fight for everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_371.wav|The pair are very much in love.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_372.wav|We used to keep our business rates.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_373.wav|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_374.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_375.wav|Everyone could see the joke.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_376.wav|All would be under threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_377.wav|I understand the frustration of the fans.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_378.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_379.wav|The seller was not revealed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_380.wav|People are on the alert.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_381.wav|I can confirm that Miss Deacon has received a threatening phone call.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_382.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_383.wav|A review is under way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_384.wav|They know it'll be fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_385.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_386.wav|Clark is back on top form.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_387.wav|Motion described it as a unique event.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_388.wav|It brought in new management.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_389.wav|My view has now completely changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_390.wav|She is in their hands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_391.wav|The following day I used the story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_392.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_393.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_394.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_395.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_396.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_397.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_398.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_399.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_400.wav|It certainly appeared that way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_401.wav|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_402.wav|We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_403.wav|I will be able to say in a couple of weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_404.wav|I remain a buyer of the shares.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_405.wav|But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_406.wav|It had been on the cards.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_407.wav|He seems to be used to the attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_408.wav|The trick is to try it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_409.wav|I would love to think that she could win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_410.wav|He may have a point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_411.wav|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_412.wav|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_413.wav|He is on the wrong side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_414.wav|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_415.wav|I've got my own ideas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_416.wav|I never had a childhood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_417.wav|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_418.wav|I think it's a miracle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_419.wav|They were not complacent in any way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_420.wav|They did the right thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_421.wav|He will be judged by his actions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_422.wav|The fate of the rest is unknown.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_423.wav|It is an absolute nonsense.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_424.wav|Young families accounted for a growing share of the trade.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_425.wav|Sadly, the surface was a nightmare.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_426.wav|Everything in golf is a balance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_427.wav|It is a case of pity for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_428.wav|I believe the gap is nearly there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_429.wav|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_430.wav|We've got a good management record.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_431.wav|It was that bad, that low.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_432.wav|Paris is not only young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_433.wav|However, the downturn has forced the overdraft request.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_434.wav|But you can go beyond that condition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_435.wav|But we have built a platform for next season.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_436.wav|It looked like a war zone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_437.wav|He said current trading was strong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_438.wav|I chose to make a film.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_439.wav|I can tell you Labour is fighting to win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_440.wav|But by that time, it was too late.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_441.wav|The damage is all inside.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_442.wav|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_443.wav|We would have concerns about that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_444.wav|I know the worry over Iraq.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_445.wav|Taxes may need to rise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_446.wav|Equally the employee could claim a public interest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_447.wav|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_448.wav|No options are excluded at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_449.wav|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_450.wav|We are going for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_451.wav|Miss Jackson was not present to put her case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_452.wav|It is a cause for concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_453.wav|The weather in the area of the crash was severe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_454.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_455.wav|He deserved a red card.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_456.wav|They were not even allowed to see them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_457.wav|And she is very clear on this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_458.wav|And it covers the spectrum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_459.wav|Dennis was not so sure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_460.wav|The chief constable has retired.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_461.wav|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_462.wav|It is a crisis, without a doubt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_463.wav|Not if you know the person.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_464.wav|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_465.wav|I was all image and no substance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_466.wav|The boys are mentally focused.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_467.wav|It can all be done over the phone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_468.wav|The bill would be massive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_469.wav|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_470.wav|Neither woman has been named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_471.wav|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_472.wav|We live by the rule of law.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_473.wav|They make a selective perception process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_474.wav|He was a shooting star.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_475.wav|I could feel the blood on my face.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_476.wav|I am a committed European.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_477.wav|Analysts said the offer was fair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_478.wav|These people attack the core of my beliefs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_479.wav|Then came the farewell to Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_480.wav|It is a vicious circle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_481.wav|He will be advised by me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_482.wav|Winning a medal is a dream.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_483.wav|We had to add value.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_484.wav|That is the bottom line.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_485.wav|It happens on an annual basis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_486.wav|However, he emphasised the bank was satisfied with progress.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_487.wav|We have to go for a win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_488.wav|It worked well in Monaco.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_489.wav|Something has got to change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_490.wav|I had it before the final.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_491.wav|Our fans have been marvellous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_492.wav|The BBC was a disgrace.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_493.wav|I would put my money on Peter Donald.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_494.wav|It was still there, but right at the end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_495.wav|The Prime Minister has been in touch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_496.wav|They never gave up hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_497.wav|He had planned to sell it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_498.wav|I was ready for this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_499.wav|In fact, we were all over the shop.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_500.wav|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_501.wav|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_502.wav|I stayed away from the defence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p236/p236_503.wav|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_025.wav|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_026.wav|They should be so lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_027.wav|I have a theory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_028.wav|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_029.wav|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_030.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_031.wav|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_032.wav|There's a story, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_033.wav|This is the window.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_034.wav|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_035.wav|I'd like to continue that record.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_036.wav|They're just different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_037.wav|It was clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_038.wav|It is not for any other purpose.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_039.wav|The problem is the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_040.wav|It's a great thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_041.wav|He did not know his daughter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_042.wav|This film will be totally awesome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_043.wav|That is a break with tradition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_044.wav|It's the only thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_045.wav|It is so sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_046.wav|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_047.wav|It is urgent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_048.wav|I feel pretty good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_049.wav|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_050.wav|It is bizarre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_051.wav|That should do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_052.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_053.wav|She looked so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_054.wav|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_055.wav|Life is good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_056.wav|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_057.wav|I was inspired by two things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_058.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_059.wav|We were surprised to see the photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_060.wav|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_061.wav|I've had six days of rehearsal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_062.wav|None has ever been found.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_063.wav|It's a real challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_064.wav|You do not change overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_065.wav|Art is extra.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_066.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_067.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_068.wav|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_069.wav|It is like a river running by my home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_070.wav|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_071.wav|Try to save us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_072.wav|The end result is precisely the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_073.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_074.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_075.wav|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_076.wav|The price cuts are really exciting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_077.wav|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_078.wav|It is a terrible place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_079.wav|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_080.wav|It may well have been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_081.wav|It's all going to clear the debt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_082.wav|I first met him last summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_083.wav|He is driven.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_084.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_085.wav|Someone who cares
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_086.wav|It's never too late.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_087.wav|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_088.wav|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_089.wav|Now the system is right behind us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_090.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_091.wav|Today I couldn't run on it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_092.wav|However, it did not end that way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_093.wav|We must look forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_094.wav|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_095.wav|Until you hit the big games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_096.wav|We could not get any possession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_097.wav|I love the Dome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_098.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_099.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_100.wav|They were outside the circle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_101.wav|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_102.wav|But it was a pleasure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_103.wav|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_104.wav|We want to get to the final, anyway.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_105.wav|I didn't play well last year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_106.wav|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_107.wav|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_108.wav|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_109.wav|It is normal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_110.wav|Further protests are likely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_111.wav|It's in his blood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_112.wav|Who would be right ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_113.wav|It's a shame.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_114.wav|I came to complete.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_117.wav|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_118.wav|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_119.wav|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_120.wav|Does this mean.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_121.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_122.wav|It is a delight on every level.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_123.wav|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_124.wav|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_125.wav|But it took a lot of bottle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_126.wav|I thought it was a fantastic game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_127.wav|I'm so angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_128.wav|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_129.wav|She really suffered for her art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_130.wav|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_131.wav|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_132.wav|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_133.wav|Who will attend ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_134.wav|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_135.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_136.wav|They made such decisions in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_137.wav|It's perfectly feasible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_138.wav|They took a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_139.wav|The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_140.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_141.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_142.wav|He has the edge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_143.wav|Three penalties were given.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_144.wav|It seems so long since I did the exams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_145.wav|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_146.wav|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_147.wav|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_148.wav|He is severe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_149.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_150.wav|Is that Titanic ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_151.wav|The idea is simple.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_153.wav|He will emerge as a world leader.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_154.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_155.wav|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_156.wav|It is huge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_157.wav|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_159.wav|It is not normal practice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_160.wav|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_161.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_162.wav|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_163.wav|We are now up against it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_164.wav|I was in daily contact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_165.wav|He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_166.wav|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_167.wav|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_168.wav|They should stop the bombing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_169.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_170.wav|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_171.wav|I was in the train station overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_172.wav|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_173.wav|He is keen to stay in public service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_174.wav|I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_175.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_176.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_177.wav|The release attracted little attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_178.wav|Waiting times for these services are too long.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_179.wav|He was a crazy man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_180.wav|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_181.wav|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_182.wav|One season, they might do well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_183.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_184.wav|This is a sad day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_185.wav|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_186.wav|The hotel was now for sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_187.wav|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_188.wav|Government will intervene.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_189.wav|Four policemen were wounded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_190.wav|They receive a high profile in the media.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_191.wav|It's a joke.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_192.wav|Miller was every bit as happy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_193.wav|I wish I could say something.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_194.wav|It is tough, but possible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_195.wav|I've got good news and bad news for you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_196.wav|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_198.wav|If the director is with you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_199.wav|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_200.wav|It is a case of taking a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_201.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_202.wav|Our strategy is straightforward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_203.wav|Is that success ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_204.wav|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_205.wav|Tommy is not a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_206.wav|The sisters also became the two top players in the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_207.wav|He was also married with two children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_208.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_210.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_211.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_212.wav|I don't want to use it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_213.wav|Now, it's all right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_214.wav|There was an e-mail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_215.wav|Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_216.wav|It is a gamble.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_217.wav|He is slightly confused.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_218.wav|She should not be blamed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_219.wav|I began to pray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_220.wav|I had decided to quit the show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_221.wav|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_222.wav|By hard work, is the answer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_223.wav|The FBI could become involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_224.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_225.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_226.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_227.wav|You have to do your research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_228.wav|William Hague delighted his party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_229.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_230.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_231.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_232.wav|I am immensely sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_233.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_234.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_235.wav|I can't wait to meet him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_236.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_237.wav|They are the innocent victims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_238.wav|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_239.wav|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_240.wav|You take a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_241.wav|They tried to give her advice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_242.wav|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_243.wav|It's a dead end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_244.wav|We are in the hat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_245.wav|Of course, that is not the whole story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_246.wav|They should come forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_247.wav|It is not the message alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_248.wav|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_249.wav|He says that he is no different from any other man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_250.wav|It's quite a line-up !
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_251.wav|It's a lovely, lovely film.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_252.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_253.wav|We were extremely poor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_254.wav|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_255.wav|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_256.wav|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_257.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_258.wav|Both reports appear in the British Medical Journal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_259.wav|You can feel at home in China.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_260.wav|Our decision making was poor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_262.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_263.wav|They are different types.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_264.wav|There's the mix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_265.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_266.wav|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_267.wav|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_268.wav|That could be in place by next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_270.wav|Special measures were needed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_271.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_272.wav|This is a big club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_273.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_274.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_275.wav|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_276.wav|It is also very valuable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_277.wav|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_278.wav|The warning is timely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_279.wav|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_280.wav|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_281.wav|There is no link.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_282.wav|This is a question of Islam.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_283.wav|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_284.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_285.wav|Immediate action must be taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_286.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_287.wav|We're in shock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_288.wav|You know the type.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_289.wav|She failed in her action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_290.wav|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_291.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_292.wav|They seem to get away with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_293.wav|People have no choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_294.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_295.wav|I saw it at a ruck.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_296.wav|I intended to look for another club on loan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_297.wav|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_298.wav|Holland won by five wickets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_299.wav|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_300.wav|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_301.wav|That could change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_302.wav|He should have won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_303.wav|Who can predict ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_304.wav|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_305.wav|We have to sort it out ourselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_306.wav|I was the sheep.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_307.wav|Graeme was prepared.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_308.wav|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_309.wav|It is a road of death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_310.wav|This is a war over our home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_311.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_312.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_313.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_314.wav|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_315.wav|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_316.wav|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_317.wav|It is no surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_318.wav|We want to play at the worlds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_320.wav|They were fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_321.wav|I never thought it would take this long.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_322.wav|They wanted the club to make money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_323.wav|It should be equal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_325.wav|We are very strongly behind the bid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_326.wav|In the old days, it was easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_327.wav|The parents will have a great time, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_328.wav|It is a job creation scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_329.wav|I am so upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_330.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_331.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_332.wav|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_333.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_334.wav|I saw some good things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_335.wav|He can do no wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_337.wav|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_338.wav|There was a bit of urgency in the second half.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_339.wav|They haven't got a hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_340.wav|It has moved on in the last week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_341.wav|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_342.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_343.wav|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_344.wav|The train was on time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_345.wav|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_346.wav|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_347.wav|Indeed, it was magical.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_348.wav|Look at the witnesses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_349.wav|Nobody else was with me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_350.wav|The composer will conduct.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p237/p237_351.wav|It should be scrapped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_001.wav|Please call Stella.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_025.wav|Smoking is also very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_026.wav|The first appeared to be successful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_027.wav|We must convince the citizens.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_028.wav|There was a rush of water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_029.wav|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_030.wav|Further management changes are planned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_031.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_032.wav|The staff are very good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_033.wav|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_034.wav|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_035.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_036.wav|Let there be no doubt about that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_037.wav|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_038.wav|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_039.wav|And so was a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_040.wav|I remember that day well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_041.wav|She became a heroine of my childhood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_042.wav|We want to get back into the Champions League.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_043.wav|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_044.wav|It is about regular committed giving which is the real attraction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_045.wav|This represents a tough game for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_046.wav|Separate approvals would be needed for these.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_047.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_048.wav|Among them are many criminals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_049.wav|It comes from reflection or thinking.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_050.wav|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_051.wav|And they removed a Borderer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_052.wav|He is too weak to move.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_053.wav|Does it matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_054.wav|How do you take them away ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_055.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_056.wav|After the match, do you ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_057.wav|Has the conflict started ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_058.wav|Have I really come to this ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_059.wav|They desperately want some stability.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_060.wav|Well, he is an artist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_061.wav|We work for the athlete.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_062.wav|He looks like an Afghan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_063.wav|Everything else is a bonus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_064.wav|He will need that machine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_065.wav|We hadn't really taken that seriously before.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_066.wav|It's the performance we want.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_067.wav|Then they scored two goals to win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_068.wav|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_069.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_070.wav|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_071.wav|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_072.wav|I had relied on him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_073.wav|And then there's the racial hassle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_074.wav|We felt it was sufficient.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_075.wav|The wingers must have felt the cold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_076.wav|I am relishing the challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_077.wav|I have made that offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_078.wav|No plans for projects are yet in place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_079.wav|But the organisers refused to worry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_080.wav|We have to keep our clients.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_081.wav|We should be able to cope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_082.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_083.wav|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_084.wav|He's very young and very keen to do well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_085.wav|It is somewhere to be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_086.wav|We should all be grateful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_087.wav|We will pay their bills.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_088.wav|It was exactly four months away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_089.wav|This is equally relevant to the landowner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_090.wav|He thought she was amazing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_091.wav|The result is utterly compelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_092.wav|Final proposals will be published in February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_093.wav|He seems to have everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_094.wav|There can be no compromise on welfare.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_095.wav|It wasn't possible to relax.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_096.wav|He was at home with his pals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_097.wav|I was very pleased with them today, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_098.wav|Maybe this battle has been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_099.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_100.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_101.wav|It will take a few years before we see the full benefit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_102.wav|It's very dangerous for markets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_103.wav|The fans would love it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_104.wav|That would be the case with Dundee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_105.wav|Brian Wilson is a former Member to watch award winner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_106.wav|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_107.wav|Their mandate is to target inflation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_108.wav|We have thought about doing lots of things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_109.wav|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_110.wav|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_111.wav|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_112.wav|Harrowing is easy, after all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_113.wav|Those people must be accountable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_114.wav|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_115.wav|It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_116.wav|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_117.wav|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_118.wav|It's going to be epic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_119.wav|What form did that take ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_120.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_121.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_122.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_123.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_124.wav|So what happens next ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_125.wav|Had this been common practice ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_126.wav|What do they want us to do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_127.wav|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_128.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_129.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_130.wav|Potions said he would drive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_131.wav|This is a sizeable part of our business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_132.wav|Diversions were put in place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_133.wav|We're very interested in opening up in Germany.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_134.wav|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_135.wav|No one person or small group could be singled out.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_136.wav|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_137.wav|I won't make an official complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_138.wav|Monty is great in his own backyard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_139.wav|Brown also believes in Walker's innocence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_140.wav|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_141.wav|Even the winning club was within seconds of disaster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_142.wav|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_143.wav|But it looks good for next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_144.wav|All the employees are redundant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_145.wav|His claims were criticised by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Smith.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_146.wav|Four meetings have previously been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_147.wav|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_148.wav|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_149.wav|And they all have a vote.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_150.wav|It is a vicious circle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_151.wav|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_152.wav|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_154.wav|They make a selective perception process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_155.wav|That's what happened against Ayr.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_156.wav|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_157.wav|The following are the principal provisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_158.wav|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_159.wav|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_160.wav|His job was not advertised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_161.wav|He was just like a godfather to it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_162.wav|The milk industry is in turmoil.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_163.wav|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_164.wav|Yet the survey has been cautious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_165.wav|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_166.wav|YOU cannot blame the turnout.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_167.wav|We can't get over it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_168.wav|They almost achieved a draw.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_169.wav|I can see it now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_170.wav|This is a step backwards.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_171.wav|I've no idea how it works.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_172.wav|We continue to hold the shares.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_173.wav|The festivals will be about having fun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_174.wav|Emergency services were also on stand-by outside.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_175.wav|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_176.wav|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_177.wav|The changes took effect from June.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_178.wav|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_179.wav|You can spend money on housing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_180.wav|Since then, things have improved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_181.wav|We're very fortunate to have these new products to focus on.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_182.wav|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_183.wav|Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_184.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_185.wav|But we could only help a handful of people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_186.wav|Scottish football is finally on its way back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_187.wav|This is a frightening development.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_188.wav|He is survived by his wife and two sons.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_189.wav|This should begin in October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_190.wav|You just have to accept.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_191.wav|There is no evidence that these people are helpful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_192.wav|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_193.wav|The squad is too small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_194.wav|He has had success at every level.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_195.wav|This Patton will also return.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_196.wav|Tiger is not the norm.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_197.wav|His words were not audible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_198.wav|You are a gambling man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_199.wav|Did he trip ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_200.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_201.wav|Did it work ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_202.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_203.wav|Is our children learning ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_204.wav|How independent is that ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_206.wav|Truth is the child of time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_207.wav|There was a fine line to tread.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_208.wav|The refund is fully justified.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_209.wav|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_211.wav|But experts have disputed that statistic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_212.wav|It is time for confession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_213.wav|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_214.wav|Hospital staff described his condition as serious but stable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_215.wav|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_216.wav|It was started almost by accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_217.wav|I will not take part in Edmonton.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_218.wav|We will try to find someone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_219.wav|Bottling is now the core business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_220.wav|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_221.wav|The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_222.wav|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_223.wav|We were right to be afraid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_224.wav|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_225.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_226.wav|I am considered a teenager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_227.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_228.wav|Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_229.wav|That view has not altered.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_230.wav|Its's all change at Kilmarnock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_231.wav|So I got a blood test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_232.wav|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_233.wav|Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_234.wav|There's always the next century.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_235.wav|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_236.wav|That proved enough to settle the home side down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_237.wav|Here was an anti supporting the Bill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_238.wav|Five years later, the deception continued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_239.wav|Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_240.wav|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_241.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_242.wav|It is not normal practice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_243.wav|It is crucial for both teams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_244.wav|Mr Blair had done well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_245.wav|I was a lucky man tonight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_246.wav|Then we will face the Danish champions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_247.wav|But it couldn't happen overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_248.wav|It would seem a natural progression.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_249.wav|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_250.wav|My Dad is a hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_251.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_252.wav|was everything done to save people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_253.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_254.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_255.wav|Is it in the right place ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_256.wav|This wasn't just a big crowd.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_257.wav|It was a terrible combination of factors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_258.wav|This is absolutely not true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_259.wav|Arsenal refused to be evicted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_260.wav|It's about time something was done about equipment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_261.wav|They should stop the bombing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_262.wav|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_263.wav|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_264.wav|It is a terrible tragedy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_265.wav|The agreement remains the only show in town.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_266.wav|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_267.wav|The strong performance is expected to continue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_268.wav|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_269.wav|It was a bit of a tightrope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_270.wav|It's never great to finish second.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_271.wav|I'm delighted that Celtic have done so well this season.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_272.wav|Her political persuasion is no secret.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_273.wav|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_274.wav|He is a right bastard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_275.wav|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_276.wav|They could not match it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_277.wav|He is not a pathetic figure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_278.wav|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_279.wav|I came up through the ranks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_280.wav|You've got to be vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_281.wav|First, the programme was unbalanced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_282.wav|The happiness was slightly misplaced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_283.wav|Phase one was a shambles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_284.wav|This championship is different from the other majors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_285.wav|But I was glad to see these interviews.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_286.wav|Each case is treated on merit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_287.wav|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_288.wav|Says the Duke of York.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_289.wav|He is a serial Conservative assassin.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_290.wav|We've just had it confirmed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_291.wav|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_292.wav|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_293.wav|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_294.wav|We've had great things in the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_295.wav|It has been recorded twice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_296.wav|But there's an upturn in the sector.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_297.wav|I'm interested in interesting work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_298.wav|They will probably come back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_299.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_300.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_301.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_302.wav|What are you not good at ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_303.wav|I think, therefore I am ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_304.wav|Who was she ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_305.wav|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_306.wav|No-one is predicting a sudden rebound.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_307.wav|Friday night was a pretty good night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_308.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_309.wav|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_310.wav|We are trying to clarify the issues.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_311.wav|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_312.wav|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_313.wav|Movie stars are public property.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_314.wav|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_315.wav|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_316.wav|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_317.wav|Here the picture is broadly stable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_318.wav|Sadly, it does not end there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_319.wav|Jim has not been a problem for me at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_320.wav|Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_321.wav|We believe a third party was involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_322.wav|And we have the experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_323.wav|The early physical reports were clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_324.wav|Celtic were the losers then.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_325.wav|Their conclusions were never published.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_326.wav|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_327.wav|Little is known about them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_328.wav|Margins are also in retreat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_329.wav|Golf is not like that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_330.wav|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_331.wav|The move follows a review of the Singapore
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_332.wav|Which isn't a bad idea.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_333.wav|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_334.wav|They will always be in our hearts and in our minds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_335.wav|He was admitted to hospital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_336.wav|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_337.wav|Abbey National is an option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_338.wav|We've had him with us for the past six weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_339.wav|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_340.wav|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_341.wav|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_342.wav|He is the son of former chairman, Lord Wolfson.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_343.wav|Scottish consumer protection groups were generally receptive to the proposals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_344.wav|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_345.wav|My daughter is an adult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_346.wav|His third goal was superb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_347.wav|I'm very relieved that I have finally won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_349.wav|My father died in childbirth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_350.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_351.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_352.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_353.wav|This measure is not adjusted for seasonal factors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_354.wav|They're going to open in early summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_355.wav|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_356.wav|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_357.wav|And the World Cup has not even begun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_358.wav|He remains a main board director of Royal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_359.wav|People should make their own decisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_360.wav|I saw them last week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_361.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_362.wav|It was a good workout.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_363.wav|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_364.wav|William Hague delighted his party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_365.wav|His background is firmly in venture capital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_366.wav|We played them off the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_368.wav|We can have no complaints.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_369.wav|The statement contained no surprises.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_370.wav|Not that Barber has been unhappy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_371.wav|We will likely look for new investors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_372.wav|But the rally was short-lived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_373.wav|But you never won any games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_374.wav|It didn't matter who was in their way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_375.wav|And he goes with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_376.wav|I have little time for analysts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_377.wav|The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_378.wav|It was really quite amazing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_379.wav|It represents a complete change in emphasis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_380.wav|It is the voice of the survivors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_381.wav|It was cynical and callous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_382.wav|He did not say that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_383.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_384.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_385.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_386.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_387.wav|Pensions are a long-term investment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_388.wav|His successor was only appointed last month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_389.wav|I've had three shots and got nowhere near.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_390.wav|It's difficult to put a date on.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_391.wav|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_392.wav|Those overseas offices were great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_393.wav|You will have seen the adverts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_394.wav|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_395.wav|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_396.wav|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_397.wav|Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_398.wav|Standard Life has also highlighted ambitions in this market.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_399.wav|Colin is free to speak with other teams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_400.wav|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_401.wav|He left the hospital without receiving any medication.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_402.wav|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_403.wav|That remains the unanswered question.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_404.wav|Everything has its place and purpose.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_405.wav|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_406.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_407.wav|And it had two seats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_408.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_409.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_410.wav|But nothing could be done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_411.wav|This is a historic occasion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_412.wav|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_413.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_414.wav|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_415.wav|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_416.wav|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_417.wav|This would discourage investment and job creation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_418.wav|We have no information on Iraq.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_419.wav|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_420.wav|They prefer the short, intensive session.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_421.wav|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_422.wav|The company declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_423.wav|It also makes a habit of collecting people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_424.wav|Got to get my sunglasses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_425.wav|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_426.wav|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_427.wav|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_428.wav|Messages have to be reinforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_429.wav|Not many people like to do that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_430.wav|We accept the new rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_431.wav|We go there with confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_432.wav|It was like the old days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_433.wav|They are interior designers and architects.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_434.wav|They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_435.wav|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_436.wav|The only problem was, they were on himself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_437.wav|We are aiming for early March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_438.wav|We discovered that for ourselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_439.wav|It is also very valuable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_440.wav|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_441.wav|None of this work is guaranteed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_442.wav|Now we see no mention of rising rates.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_443.wav|Still, some additions are inspired.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_444.wav|I believe we can handle this okay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_445.wav|The whole experience was uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_446.wav|Hard cash is needed now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_447.wav|I stayed away from the defence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_448.wav|Our performance continues to be outstanding.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_449.wav|Celtic are simply trying to buy time by not paying the money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_450.wav|Either way, it's very funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_451.wav|It has become a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_452.wav|We didn't want any trouble.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_453.wav|It seemed a logical expansion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_454.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_455.wav|Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_456.wav|Now it has doubled in size.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_458.wav|I have worked as a stand-up there often.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_459.wav|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p238/p238_460.wav|It is business as usual.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_001.wav|Please call Stella.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_025.wav|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_026.wav|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_027.wav|And so was a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_028.wav|We are not aware of any British casualties at this stage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_029.wav|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_030.wav|It is about control of our economy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_031.wav|There was a rush of water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_032.wav|That's all I was trying to do today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_033.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_034.wav|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_035.wav|I might well have done so already.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_036.wav|That can cost him a fortune.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_037.wav|He works at the airport.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_038.wav|How do you take them away ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_039.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_040.wav|After the match, do you ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_041.wav|Has the conflict started ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_042.wav|Have I really come to this ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_043.wav|This matter has still to come before the European Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_044.wav|It carried a double message.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_045.wav|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_046.wav|But not a penny has been paid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_047.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_048.wav|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_049.wav|We must learn to finish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_050.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_051.wav|New York is my home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_052.wav|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_053.wav|I remember that day well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_054.wav|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_055.wav|He is too weak to move.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_056.wav|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_057.wav|I feel we might now have the foundations to go forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_058.wav|Among them are many criminals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_059.wav|That's been the difference between the sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_060.wav|And they removed a Borderer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_061.wav|All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_062.wav|Perhaps we should do the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_063.wav|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_064.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_065.wav|They desperately want some stability.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_066.wav|Everything is possible in football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_067.wav|Everyone could see the joke.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_068.wav|I'm pleased with the horse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_069.wav|He will need that machine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_070.wav|The new clubhouse was packed with people watching the game on TV.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_071.wav|Then they scored two goals to win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_072.wav|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_073.wav|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_074.wav|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_075.wav|Let's not be too despondent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_076.wav|The Government does not go far enough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_077.wav|He phoned the number in the brochure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_078.wav|I haven't got there yet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_079.wav|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_080.wav|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_081.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_082.wav|Labour has replaced the Tories as the party of the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_083.wav|But the organisers refused to worry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_084.wav|And it had two seats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_085.wav|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_086.wav|Or so the theory goes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_087.wav|He has really done well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_088.wav|So what happens next ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_089.wav|Had this been common practice ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_090.wav|What do they want us to do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_091.wav|Is it worth it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_092.wav|Does it matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_093.wav|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_094.wav|But I had never been in a theatre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_095.wav|It was fun, but not a living.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_096.wav|Kenny Miller might come through.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_097.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_098.wav|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_099.wav|We will pay their bills.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_100.wav|Sales are falling after years of growth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_101.wav|It was exactly four months away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_102.wav|But they also noted a partial strengthening of survey evidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_103.wav|We have a major concern about enforcement action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_104.wav|I am so proud of him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_105.wav|This time, it might be for real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_106.wav|He will be kept informed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_107.wav|There could be a way back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_108.wav|He was a lovely man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_109.wav|People will have to be patient.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_110.wav|I can't remember a lot of it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_111.wav|Instead, another depression came in.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_112.wav|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_113.wav|We have thought about doing lots of things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_114.wav|It is sometimes like that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_115.wav|The partners are looking for answers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_116.wav|I've had it for the exams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_117.wav|Those people must be accountable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_118.wav|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_119.wav|The Festival is prepared to help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_120.wav|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_121.wav|The error appeared in a warrant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_122.wav|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_123.wav|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_124.wav|He was just a journalist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_125.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_126.wav|Their season has been consigned to history.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_127.wav|Diversions were put in place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_128.wav|How independent is that ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_129.wav|What form did that take ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_130.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_131.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_132.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_133.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_134.wav|Maybe he has been away from British football for too long.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_135.wav|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_136.wav|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_137.wav|Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_138.wav|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_139.wav|It is the only practical access for vehicles and men.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_140.wav|So it was at Easter Road.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_141.wav|A move to Manchester United would be tremendous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_142.wav|Absences should be carefully monitored.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_143.wav|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_144.wav|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_145.wav|We just have to adapt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_146.wav|He was forced to quit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_147.wav|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_148.wav|People have been placed in a state of alarm.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_149.wav|I was given no instructions by no-one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_150.wav|The move follows a review of the Singapore
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_151.wav|Which isn't a bad idea.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_152.wav|Since then, things have improved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_153.wav|That's what happened against Ayr.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_154.wav|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_155.wav|He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_156.wav|It is a good lifestyle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_157.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_158.wav|Our relationship has been very good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_159.wav|It was the climax of the thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_160.wav|Nato has left them with no other option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_161.wav|Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_162.wav|I think the referee was good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_163.wav|I understand the medical concerns.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_164.wav|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_165.wav|This was a unique election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_166.wav|They exist in name alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_167.wav|We have reacted well to each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_168.wav|I can see it now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_169.wav|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_170.wav|There's still plenty time left.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_171.wav|Those three weeks are totally lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_172.wav|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_173.wav|She is in good spirits.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_174.wav|As if that is an achievement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_175.wav|Mr Blair should be warned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_176.wav|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_177.wav|There was a fossil on screen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_178.wav|Is it in the right place ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_179.wav|Did he trip ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_180.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_181.wav|Did it work ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_182.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_183.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_184.wav|Structural changes were also required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_185.wav|His job was not advertised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_186.wav|That was just one night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_187.wav|This is a frightening development.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_188.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_189.wav|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_190.wav|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_191.wav|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_192.wav|My father died in childbirth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_193.wav|In addition, margins have been maintained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_194.wav|Such an appointment could go some way to reassure investors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_195.wav|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_196.wav|Two years of building a business will go up in smoke.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_197.wav|You've got to be vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_198.wav|He said the director had been completely friendly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_199.wav|Tiger is not the norm.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_200.wav|It's been a humbling year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_201.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_202.wav|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_203.wav|It is all to do with the coaching.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_204.wav|There was a fine line to tread.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_205.wav|The refund is fully justified.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_206.wav|My wife and family are the support system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_207.wav|We are now working with full-time on future product.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_208.wav|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_209.wav|He is a very talented player.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_210.wav|Bottling is now the core business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_211.wav|I would be surprised if he decided to give up.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_212.wav|The protest will go ahead as planned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_213.wav|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_214.wav|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_215.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_216.wav|We had to add value.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_217.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_218.wav|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_219.wav|So I got a blood test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_220.wav|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_221.wav|I was caught out a little bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_222.wav|There's always the next century.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_223.wav|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_224.wav|But it's an enjoyable job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_225.wav|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_226.wav|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_227.wav|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_228.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_229.wav|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_230.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_231.wav|Then we will face the Danish champions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_232.wav|It would seem a natural progression.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_233.wav|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_234.wav|We will turn the corner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_235.wav|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_236.wav|My Dad is a hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_237.wav|Jackie is passionate about Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_238.wav|Further details are expected later.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_239.wav|This is absolutely not true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_240.wav|They should stop the bombing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_241.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_242.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_243.wav|was everything done to save people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_244.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_245.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_246.wav|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_247.wav|I've learned from my mistakes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_248.wav|Adams is surely worth a chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_249.wav|This season has been a mixture of frustration and fulfilment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_250.wav|I've come here for the jersey.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_251.wav|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_252.wav|The strong performance is expected to continue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_253.wav|The challenge for the industry is to capture and retain that talent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_254.wav|She replied, It could be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_255.wav|Allen is strong in every shape and form.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_256.wav|Her political persuasion is no secret.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_257.wav|We have a budget in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_258.wav|ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_259.wav|We have expanded too quickly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_260.wav|I'd been out with my girlfriend and we were attacked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_261.wav|Boats and other equipment would be pooled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_262.wav|Stewart Ivory also declined to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_263.wav|Our position remains the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_264.wav|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_265.wav|They could not match it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_266.wav|He is not a pathetic figure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_267.wav|The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_268.wav|They made such decisions in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_269.wav|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_270.wav|Harrowing is easy, after all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_271.wav|Each case is treated on merit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_272.wav|A winter of discontent awaits.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_273.wav|I thought we were fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_274.wav|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_275.wav|It's going to be very closely watched.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_276.wav|It is fairly specialised and mainly for the export of breeding animals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_277.wav|They receive a high profile in the media.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_278.wav|Our destiny is in our own hands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_279.wav|Miller was every bit as happy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_280.wav|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_281.wav|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_282.wav|There is no internal damage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_283.wav|We've had great things in the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_284.wav|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_285.wav|It has been recorded twice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_286.wav|Aberdeen had little to offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_287.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_288.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_289.wav|This youngster is so exciting!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_290.wav|It was a pre-emptive strike.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_291.wav|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_292.wav|They will probably come back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_293.wav|This is a good incentive for both parties to conclude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_294.wav|I saw them last week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_295.wav|Friday night was a pretty good night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_296.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_297.wav|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_298.wav|We may need to take some very radical measures.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_299.wav|Everyone can have their opinion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_300.wav|The best thing for me was to join the Army.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_301.wav|Celtic are delaying the question of a new contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_302.wav|Mr McLeod said he believed a solution would be reached.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_303.wav|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_304.wav|That should give me a chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_305.wav|They have played their part.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_306.wav|This will be our new beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_307.wav|They have the cash and the fire power.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_308.wav|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_309.wav|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_310.wav|Racism has no place in any sport.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_311.wav|Celtic were the losers then.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_312.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_313.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_314.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_315.wav|What are you not good at ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_316.wav|I think, therefore I am ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_317.wav|Who was she ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_318.wav|The result is utterly compelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_319.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_320.wav|I have been very nervous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_321.wav|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_322.wav|There were also some interesting questions and answers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_323.wav|I won't make an official complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_324.wav|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_325.wav|It wasn't about her singing, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_326.wav|They are looking at a flotation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_327.wav|They make a selective perception process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_328.wav|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_329.wav|He was admitted to hospital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_330.wav|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_331.wav|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_332.wav|January is a bad time of year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_333.wav|And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_334.wav|Royal Bank declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_335.wav|From there, they can go anywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_336.wav|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_337.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_338.wav|We used to live with dignity in our country.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_339.wav|My daughter is an adult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_340.wav|It will affect their work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_341.wav|Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_342.wav|I am considered a teenager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_343.wav|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_344.wav|The FBI could become involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_345.wav|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_346.wav|I just felt that I was broken down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_347.wav|And the World Cup has not even begun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_348.wav|It comes from reflection or thinking.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_349.wav|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_350.wav|Translation - we got it wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_351.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_352.wav|They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_353.wav|What happened in that game ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_354.wav|Are you going to win ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_355.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_356.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_357.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_358.wav|The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Florida in October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_359.wav|William Hague delighted his party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_360.wav|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_361.wav|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_362.wav|Walker plans to return indoors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_363.wav|The actual increases will be announced next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_364.wav|The statement contained no surprises.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_365.wav|The scientific debate is dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_366.wav|This would include the GM food industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_367.wav|But the rally was short-lived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_368.wav|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_369.wav|They are the innocent victims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_370.wav|It didn't matter who was in their way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_371.wav|He ended up a headmaster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_372.wav|That took about two years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_373.wav|He is obviously very dangerous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_374.wav|That remains the unanswered question.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_375.wav|This should come as no surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_376.wav|It was launched in February last year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_377.wav|Commitment is released on Liberty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_378.wav|I love the spectacle of cinema.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_379.wav|He did not say that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_380.wav|Pensions are a long-term investment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_381.wav|We have not been approached.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_382.wav|Murray Johnstone will replace it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_383.wav|North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_384.wav|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_385.wav|Those overseas offices were great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_386.wav|Well, that's just a third district.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_387.wav|She asked for the appointment with me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_388.wav|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_389.wav|A new school will be built.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_390.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_391.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_392.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_393.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_394.wav|His leader wanted to celebrate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_395.wav|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_396.wav|This fact is supported by audience research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_397.wav|Because of that I didn't enjoy the game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_398.wav|We were beaten by the better team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_399.wav|Both sides have to step back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_400.wav|Analysts were impressed with progress made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_401.wav|Everything has its place and purpose.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_402.wav|I have received no explanation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_403.wav|Turnover was highest in telecoms.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_404.wav|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_405.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_406.wav|This game is very evenly balanced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_407.wav|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_408.wav|It seems a waste of talents.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_409.wav|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_410.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_411.wav|You can feel at home in China.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_412.wav|This would discourage investment and job creation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_413.wav|We have no information on Iraq.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_414.wav|It depends on Labour, not on us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_415.wav|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_416.wav|You're not getting any goodwill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_417.wav|The baby deserves the credit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_418.wav|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_419.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_420.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_421.wav|It makes no difference to their friendship.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_422.wav|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_423.wav|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_424.wav|The capital costs are modest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_425.wav|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_426.wav|It certainly feels that way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_427.wav|This idea has been around for four years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_428.wav|Or maybe it's the other way around.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_429.wav|We are facing a health disaster if we do not act.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_430.wav|We accept the new rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_431.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_432.wav|They are interior designers and architects.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_433.wav|He was released after treatment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_434.wav|All the pieces fit together perfectly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_435.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_436.wav|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_437.wav|Things are going to change over the next six months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_438.wav|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_439.wav|The potential for Scottish beef is not limited to carcasses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_440.wav|It is also very valuable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_441.wav|The stage was set for a showdown.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_442.wav|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_443.wav|They should not feel under threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_444.wav|Any error is severely punished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_445.wav|Either group is living in fantasy land.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_446.wav|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_447.wav|Hard cash is needed now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_448.wav|Her housekeeper discovered the break-in on Thursday morning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_449.wav|Blair also had a penalty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_450.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_451.wav|Either way, it's very funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_452.wav|We didn't want any trouble.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_453.wav|It seemed a logical expansion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_454.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_455.wav|And Michael was just great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_456.wav|Now it has doubled in size.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_457.wav|It was never a free kick.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_458.wav|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_459.wav|This is a great opportunity for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_460.wav|Further savings would arise from common procurement and IT systems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_461.wav|Inventories are coming under control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_462.wav|She failed in her action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_463.wav|We will provide immediate access.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_464.wav|We also acknowledge the grief and pain of their relatives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_465.wav|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_466.wav|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_467.wav|Dunfermline manager Jimmy Calderwood was candid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_468.wav|The money is within the total allocation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_469.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_470.wav|This does not create any precedent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_471.wav|There's nothing I can say.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_472.wav|We need a visionary producer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_473.wav|The response from everyone was wonderful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_474.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_475.wav|I am sorry, but I forgot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_476.wav|Banking stocks were hit hard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_477.wav|We did something about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_478.wav|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_479.wav|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_480.wav|Five years later, the deception continued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_481.wav|The rescue package is public money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_482.wav|The death toll included five children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_483.wav|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_484.wav|Sales have been perfectly buoyant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_485.wav|I was there five months ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_486.wav|It happened again, and again, and again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_487.wav|It could well be military.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_488.wav|Holland won by five wickets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_489.wav|Other casualties were averted by the swift response of the emergency services.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_490.wav|They cannot operate without a licence from the local authority.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_491.wav|It's unlikely to be renewed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_492.wav|MOVIE stars are public property.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_493.wav|I first met him last summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_494.wav|The songs are just so good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_495.wav|The whole thing was just unreal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_496.wav|I can hardly believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_497.wav|They haven't been thought through.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_498.wav|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_499.wav|I am not unduly surprised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_500.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_501.wav|You are a different people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_502.wav|McPherson came from United Biscuits.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p239/p239_503.wav|The world record is suspicious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_018.wav|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_025.wav|Johnson was pretty low.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_026.wav|But it failed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_027.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_028.wav|Is this accurate?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_029.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_030.wav|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_031.wav|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_032.wav|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_033.wav|This is the window.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_034.wav|People love to see this stuff.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_035.wav|He took me on a tour of the wards.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_036.wav|It is marvellous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_037.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_038.wav|It has failed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_039.wav|They're just different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_040.wav|It's a real threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_041.wav|It was the eighties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_042.wav|Indeed, he does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_043.wav|President Bush is at war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_044.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_045.wav|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_046.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_047.wav|It is so sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_048.wav|That period was a struggle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_049.wav|This represents a tough game for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_050.wav|Who can say?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_051.wav|It's a blessing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_052.wav|The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_053.wav|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_054.wav|He is too weak to move.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_055.wav|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_056.wav|He had no enemies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_057.wav|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_058.wav|However the drama was still not at an end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_059.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_060.wav|That's the truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_061.wav|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_062.wav|I've had six days of rehearsal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_063.wav|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_064.wav|Art is extra.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_065.wav|Scotland had great assets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_066.wav|They are real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_067.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_068.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_069.wav|It should be devolved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_070.wav|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_071.wav|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_072.wav|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_073.wav|I was as strong as a horse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_074.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_075.wav|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_076.wav|She died in hospital two hours later.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_077.wav|Is there a new way forward?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_078.wav|I've got the shirt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_079.wav|Today she has been released.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_080.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_081.wav|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_082.wav|What has changed?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_083.wav|He is in the queue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_084.wav|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_085.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_086.wav|Someone who cares
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_087.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_088.wav|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_089.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_090.wav|That will come after the game on Saturday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_091.wav|Today I couldn't run on it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_092.wav|She told The Herald.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_093.wav|We could not get any possession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_094.wav|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_095.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_096.wav|They were outside the circle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_097.wav|He said he hoped for a first meeting within a few days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_098.wav|It was a good performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_099.wav|I see no need for change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_100.wav|We have every respect for Michelle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_101.wav|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_102.wav|He takes the job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_103.wav|They will want to perform well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_104.wav|That all hope is never lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_105.wav|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_106.wav|Getting new people interested in this music is the real reward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_107.wav|It's in his blood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_108.wav|It's a shame.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_109.wav|It had been played at festivals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_110.wav|I came to complete.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_111.wav|It's a question of perception.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_112.wav|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_113.wav|This film will be totally awesome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_114.wav|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_115.wav|I'm delighted about that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_116.wav|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_117.wav|I joined a group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_118.wav|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_119.wav|She really suffered for her art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_120.wav|It is a delight on every level.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_121.wav|You can spend money on housing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_122.wav|There were no grounds for his action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_123.wav|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_124.wav|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_125.wav|I was furious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_126.wav|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_127.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_128.wav|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_129.wav|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_130.wav|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_131.wav|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_132.wav|It was the same at Twickenham.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_133.wav|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_134.wav|It is also well received.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_135.wav|Government will intervene.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_136.wav|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_137.wav|He was in a great deal of pain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_138.wav|We want to keep the pound.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_139.wav|It seems so long since I did the exams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_140.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_141.wav|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_142.wav|Who would be right?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_143.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_144.wav|I am just trying to do my job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_145.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_146.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_147.wav|They did very well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_148.wav|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_149.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_150.wav|It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_151.wav|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_152.wav|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_153.wav|Mr Blair had done well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_154.wav|I was in daily contact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_155.wav|My Dad is a hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_156.wav|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_157.wav|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_158.wav|Was this element always there?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_159.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_160.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_161.wav|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_162.wav|I was in the train station overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_163.wav|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_164.wav|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_165.wav|Tell it like it was?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_166.wav|We have a budget in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_167.wav|That must be left to the Parole Board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_168.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_169.wav|They will do their own thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_170.wav|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_171.wav|It's quite a routine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_172.wav|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_173.wav|The hotel was now for sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_174.wav|I drove the ball well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_175.wav|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_176.wav|They know no other way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_177.wav|There is no point in looking any further.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_178.wav|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_179.wav|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_180.wav|They will run a mile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_181.wav|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_182.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_183.wav|Miller was every bit as happy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_184.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_185.wav|We want to help them through it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_186.wav|They really did a great job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_187.wav|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_188.wav|It is tough, but possible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_189.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_190.wav|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_191.wav|The procedure is the same in all cases.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_192.wav|People will ask about us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_193.wav|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_194.wav|It is a farce.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_195.wav|I am totally surprised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_196.wav|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_197.wav|It wasn't to be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_198.wav|There was no option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_199.wav|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_200.wav|But we are not immune to the problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_201.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_202.wav|Who will pay for this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_203.wav|They've got three-quarters of the way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_204.wav|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_205.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_206.wav|It's all about money, money, money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_207.wav|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_208.wav|It's a mixture of everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_209.wav|We have an election in eight days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_210.wav|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_211.wav|We'll have to work hard today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_212.wav|She should not be blamed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_213.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_214.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_215.wav|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_216.wav|His third goal was superb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_217.wav|I was so nervous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_218.wav|Work has started.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_219.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_220.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_221.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_222.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_223.wav|That has been the easy part.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_224.wav|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_225.wav|But it will be sorted out this week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_226.wav|What was the main difference?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_227.wav|I am immensely sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_228.wav|It is a gamble.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_229.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_230.wav|It's so special.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_231.wav|They are the innocent victims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_232.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_233.wav|The body follows the mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_234.wav|However, no further action was taken by police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_235.wav|And thought we would get away with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_236.wav|Jobs could go.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_237.wav|It is not the message alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_238.wav|It's quite a line-up!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_239.wav|It's very safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_240.wav|But it's a subtle process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_241.wav|Of further privacy, he had no need.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_242.wav|He was good, but not that good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_243.wav|We were extremely poor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_244.wav|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_245.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_246.wav|It is hard won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_247.wav|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_248.wav|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_249.wav|I am the opposite because I haven't played very much.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_250.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_251.wav|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_252.wav|He got the same story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_253.wav|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_254.wav|I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_255.wav|A friendship that will endure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_256.wav|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_257.wav|Her presence was almost everywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_258.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_259.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_260.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_261.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_262.wav|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_263.wav|I was happily surprised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_264.wav|They must play for each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_265.wav|It is also very valuable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_266.wav|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_267.wav|Blood samples were taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_268.wav|There is no link.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_269.wav|This is a question of Islam.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_270.wav|It looks as though he will be right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_271.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_272.wav|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_273.wav|Have a look at our accounts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_274.wav|He was also married with two children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_275.wav|And Michael was just great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_276.wav|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_277.wav|Access has been a nightmare.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_278.wav|It has been achieved by hard work and careful planning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_279.wav|It's a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_280.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_281.wav|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_282.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_283.wav|People have no choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_284.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_285.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_286.wav|If not, he should go home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_288.wav|His mother refuses to believe that she is dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_289.wav|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_290.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_291.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_292.wav|He will address the nation this evening.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_293.wav|It was a virus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_294.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_295.wav|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_296.wav|It's like a high school play.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_297.wav|Who did the recruiting?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_298.wav|He was obviously very genuine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_299.wav|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_300.wav|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_301.wav|A new school will be built.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_302.wav|We have to sort it out ourselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_303.wav|He said she was mad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_304.wav|I was the sheep.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_305.wav|There was no hint of scandal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_306.wav|The home was now under new management.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_307.wav|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_308.wav|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_309.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_310.wav|We do not expect any surplus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_311.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_312.wav|The plot is minimal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_313.wav|And he goes with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_314.wav|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_315.wav|It is no surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_316.wav|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_317.wav|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_318.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_319.wav|They were fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_320.wav|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_321.wav|We are a peaceful people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_322.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_323.wav|Henman has been warned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_324.wav|Craig is a major concern for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_325.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_326.wav|It is out there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_327.wav|Referees are easy targets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_328.wav|They had a confession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_329.wav|We do the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_330.wav|That's the law of the land.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_331.wav|Donald was his friend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_332.wav|I am so upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_333.wav|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_334.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_335.wav|The police have to act to help them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_336.wav|We agreed to disagree.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_337.wav|It could have gone either way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_338.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_339.wav|I saw some good things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_340.wav|I've not thought about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_341.wav|Who was the mystery MP?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_342.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_343.wav|It is a sign of hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_344.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_345.wav|Three years ago he would have been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_346.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_347.wav|It is so unfair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_348.wav|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_349.wav|He has to learn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_351.wav|Look at the witnesses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_352.wav|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_353.wav|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_354.wav|The composer will conduct.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_355.wav|This is a friendly match?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_357.wav|They should take their mobile phones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_358.wav|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_359.wav|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_360.wav|He had played well in that central role.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_361.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_362.wav|That is a break with tradition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_363.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_364.wav|The council said the house would have to be demolished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_365.wav|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_366.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_367.wav|As, indeed, they would be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_368.wav|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_369.wav|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_370.wav|Hartley should know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_371.wav|That would help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_372.wav|A deadline is still essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_373.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_374.wav|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_375.wav|We are looking for perfection.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_376.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_377.wav|He later became a respected High Court judge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_378.wav|It's been hard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_379.wav|It's now down in black and white.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p240/p240_380.wav|Safety was also an issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_025.wav|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_026.wav|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_027.wav|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_028.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_029.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_030.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_031.wav|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_032.wav|This is the window.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_033.wav|People love to see this stuff.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_034.wav|And we have a singer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_035.wav|He took me on a tour of the wards.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_036.wav|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_037.wav|It's nice to hear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_038.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_039.wav|It is not for any other purpose.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_040.wav|President Bush is at war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_041.wav|It was ugly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_042.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_043.wav|That period was a struggle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_044.wav|This represents a tough game for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_045.wav|We need to chat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_046.wav|That time has passed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_047.wav|As she explains.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_048.wav|He is too weak to move.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_049.wav|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_050.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_051.wav|He looks like an Afghan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_052.wav|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_053.wav|However the drama was still not at an end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_055.wav|Next league matches Celtic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_056.wav|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_057.wav|What was the main difference?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_058.wav|I was an athlete.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_059.wav|There was a battle there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_061.wav|It was all in a short period of time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_062.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_063.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_064.wav|The script was funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_065.wav|He could make it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_066.wav|Try to save us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_067.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_068.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_069.wav|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_070.wav|The company yesterday refused to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_071.wav|He highlighted a lack of staff.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_072.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_073.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_074.wav|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_075.wav|It is a job creation scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_076.wav|He is now resident in England.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_077.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_078.wav|I've got the shirt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_079.wav|This is the way things should be handled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_080.wav|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_081.wav|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_082.wav|I first met him last summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_083.wav|Nothing is yet confirmed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_084.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_085.wav|Someone who cares
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_087.wav|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_088.wav|And rugby fans can help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_089.wav|They have not done so this season so far.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_090.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_091.wav|Now the system is right behind us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_092.wav|Today I couldn't run on it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_093.wav|A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_094.wav|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_095.wav|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_096.wav|The peace process will be buried!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_098.wav|I love the Dome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_099.wav|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_100.wav|It was mayhem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_101.wav|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_102.wav|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_103.wav|We want to get to the final, anyway.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_104.wav|They will want to perform well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_105.wav|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_106.wav|I'm not depressed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_107.wav|It was his job to check.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_108.wav|Is that right?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_109.wav|You had better believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_110.wav|We want to help them through it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_111.wav|It's not a new concept in jazz.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_112.wav|The breakdown was much later in her life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_113.wav|It's not fair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_114.wav|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_115.wav|He will emerge as a world leader.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_116.wav|I'm delighted about that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_117.wav|I joined a group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_118.wav|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_119.wav|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_120.wav|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_121.wav|You can spend money on housing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_122.wav|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_123.wav|I'm so angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_124.wav|It has removed a bit of guilt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_125.wav|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_126.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_127.wav|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_128.wav|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_129.wav|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_130.wav|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_132.wav|What will happen then?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_133.wav|It's not true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_134.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_135.wav|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_136.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_137.wav|It was typical.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_138.wav|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_139.wav|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_140.wav|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_141.wav|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_142.wav|He is severe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_143.wav|Is that Titanic?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_144.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_145.wav|I am just trying to do my job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_146.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_147.wav|The home side didn't stand a chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_148.wav|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_149.wav|We want to see the maximum of change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_150.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_151.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_152.wav|They were later discharged from hospital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_153.wav|Neither side can win this war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_154.wav|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_155.wav|Was this element always there?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_157.wav|It was so new, so exciting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_158.wav|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_159.wav|I've put my own money into this project.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_160.wav|We do not get that impression now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_161.wav|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_162.wav|We have to move forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_163.wav|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_164.wav|We have a budget in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_165.wav|There was no respite.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_166.wav|They will do their own thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_167.wav|The post will be unpaid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_168.wav|Waiting times for these services are too long.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_169.wav|It is too much for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_170.wav|He was a crazy man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_171.wav|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_172.wav|It became a book by itself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_173.wav|One season, they might do well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_174.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_175.wav|And I saw the light!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_176.wav|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_177.wav|The clarity is vital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_178.wav|I drove the ball well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_179.wav|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_180.wav|They know no other way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_181.wav|It is minute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_182.wav|They will run a mile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_183.wav|Four policemen were wounded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_184.wav|We did everything by the book.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_185.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_186.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_187.wav|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_188.wav|I wish I could say something.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_189.wav|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_190.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_191.wav|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_192.wav|I wanted to put myself on the line.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_193.wav|Off I went.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_195.wav|It's the same old story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_196.wav|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_197.wav|Is that success?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_198.wav|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_199.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_200.wav|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_202.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_203.wav|He's not perfect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_204.wav|They've got three-quarters of the way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_205.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_206.wav|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_207.wav|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_208.wav|I don't want to use it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_209.wav|But I am a worried man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_210.wav|He knows a lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_211.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_212.wav|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_213.wav|His third goal was superb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_214.wav|It's been a good year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_215.wav|We want to keep the pound.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_216.wav|I was so nervous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_217.wav|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_218.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_219.wav|IT S the real thing, for sure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_220.wav|A career as a doctor is on hold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_221.wav|You have to do your research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_222.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_223.wav|We played them off the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_224.wav|But it will be sorted out this week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_225.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_226.wav|My neighbours are horrified.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_227.wav|The track is currently covered in snow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_228.wav|Who would be right?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_229.wav|It is set in Paris.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_230.wav|It is not the message alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_231.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_232.wav|Hospitals are for the ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_233.wav|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_234.wav|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_235.wav|We were extremely poor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_236.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_237.wav|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_238.wav|It is hard won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_239.wav|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_240.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_241.wav|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_242.wav|In fact, we were all over the shop.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_243.wav|The scene is about this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_244.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_245.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_246.wav|They are different types.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_247.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_248.wav|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_249.wav|This is the culture change in medicine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_250.wav|Her presence was almost everywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_251.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_252.wav|Special measures were needed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_253.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_254.wav|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_255.wav|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_256.wav|They are real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_257.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_258.wav|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_259.wav|That's the only thing I will say.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_260.wav|It was good fun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_261.wav|It looks as though he will be right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_262.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_264.wav|Immediate action must be taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_265.wav|It's very nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_266.wav|It left me with a sadness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_267.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_268.wav|And Michael was just great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_269.wav|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_270.wav|Access has been a nightmare.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_271.wav|But he is caught between a rock and a hard place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_272.wav|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_273.wav|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_274.wav|It was a privilege to work for him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_275.wav|It's so awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_276.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_277.wav|We are a grandmother.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_278.wav|We have to break that cycle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_279.wav|I saw it at a ruck.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_280.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_281.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_282.wav|Yet, it worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_283.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_284.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_285.wav|The death toll included five children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_286.wav|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_287.wav|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_288.wav|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_289.wav|It changed my life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_290.wav|A new school will be built.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_291.wav|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_292.wav|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_293.wav|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_294.wav|What has altered?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_295.wav|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_296.wav|It just came into my head that day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_297.wav|Our task is to complete the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_298.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_299.wav|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_300.wav|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_301.wav|This is a war over our home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_302.wav|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_303.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_304.wav|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_305.wav|And he goes with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_306.wav|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_307.wav|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_308.wav|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_309.wav|Is there on his hands?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_310.wav|It was a question of patience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_311.wav|I was rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_312.wav|Kids are terrible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_313.wav|It should be equal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_314.wav|Craig is a major concern for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_315.wav|The home team had an amazing start.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_317.wav|It is out there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_319.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_320.wav|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_321.wav|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_322.wav|It is a strong case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_323.wav|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_324.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_325.wav|I think I was recorded with a video camera.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_326.wav|We agreed to disagree.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_327.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_328.wav|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_329.wav|I've not thought about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_330.wav|Who was the mystery MP?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_331.wav|It's been hard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_332.wav|They should stop the bombing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_333.wav|Who will do it?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_334.wav|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_336.wav|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_337.wav|I must make that clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_338.wav|The train was on time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_340.wav|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_342.wav|I would miss him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_343.wav|Tiger is the exception.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_344.wav|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_345.wav|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_346.wav|His contract was then not renewed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_347.wav|I got a yellow card.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_349.wav|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_350.wav|There is a cup final at stake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_351.wav|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_352.wav|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_353.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_354.wav|As, indeed, they would be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_356.wav|It benefits the whole family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_357.wav|Our numbers are small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_358.wav|That would help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_359.wav|So I left.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_360.wav|We are looking for perfection.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_362.wav|This is a club on the rise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_363.wav|Equity declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_364.wav|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_365.wav|The play is based on a real-life event.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_366.wav|He could face a jail sentence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_368.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_369.wav|There was no hint of scandal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_370.wav|Safety was also an issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_371.wav|Well, the big day has arrived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_372.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_373.wav|Talks are progressing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p241/p241_374.wav|There is no signature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_025.wav|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_026.wav|His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_027.wav|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_028.wav|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_029.wav|The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_030.wav|She brought a lot to my life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_031.wav|Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_032.wav|Thomson and his family left court without comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_033.wav|I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_034.wav|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_036.wav|Each brand was owned by a different family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_037.wav|That was not perfect golf by any means.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_038.wav|He added that her comments were noted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_039.wav|She will get through it I'm sure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_040.wav|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_041.wav|Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_042.wav|He does not even trust his own members.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_043.wav|He too started on the subs seats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_044.wav|Is it worth it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_045.wav|Does it matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_046.wav|How do you take them away ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_047.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_048.wav|After the match, do you ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_049.wav|Has the conflict started ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_050.wav|Have I really come to this ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_051.wav|I'm as fit as I can get.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_052.wav|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_053.wav|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_054.wav|The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_055.wav|Andy was a huge influence yet again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_056.wav|They seem too much of a sure thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_057.wav|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_058.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_059.wav|We just want this season to end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_060.wav|It was a day she thought she would never see.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_061.wav|Talks have continued at many different levels.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_062.wav|The referee is there to decide these things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_063.wav|There were no details of the other five victims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_064.wav|It also has a good labour supply.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_065.wav|Indeed he has a lot of output.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_066.wav|Do not give your details to anyone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_067.wav|He was failed by his health authority.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_068.wav|But it was not all bad news.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_069.wav|I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_070.wav|But during the bid process, that changed completely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_071.wav|It turned me against the whole system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_072.wav|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_073.wav|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_074.wav|But two groups refused to sign up.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_075.wav|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_076.wav|It had little effect on European equity markets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_077.wav|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_078.wav|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_079.wav|The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_080.wav|They said our costs were too high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_081.wav|I do not attempt to answer that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_082.wav|It's been a great evening for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_083.wav|That kind of growth is the important thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_084.wav|A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_085.wav|No plan for projects are yet in place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_086.wav|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_087.wav|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_088.wav|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_089.wav|I feel I did not have enough time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_090.wav|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_091.wav|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_092.wav|Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_093.wav|They had the appeal of TV stars.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_094.wav|There is no issue of national security involved here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_095.wav|He will be a very hard act to follow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_096.wav|Earlier, both main parties had agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_097.wav|Put simply, it goes something like this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_098.wav|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_099.wav|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_100.wav|I am delighted to hear this news.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_101.wav|We are already seeing some positive results.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_102.wav|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_103.wav|We were under a bit of pressure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_104.wav|They won't actually make any money from it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_105.wav|I bought a flat six years ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_106.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_107.wav|They are a different team at home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_108.wav|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_109.wav|Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_110.wav|Some young girls also came by last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_111.wav|Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_112.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_113.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_114.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_115.wav|So what happens next ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_116.wav|Had this been common practice ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_117.wav|What do they want us to do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_118.wav|The idea is the shop within a shop.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_119.wav|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_120.wav|It is the right package for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_121.wav|They have no real friends in the region.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_122.wav|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_123.wav|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_125.wav|I think there's not much between them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_126.wav|So I am going in the right direction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_127.wav|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_128.wav|We have to offer value for money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_129.wav|It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_130.wav|I could live without the attention, he admitted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_131.wav|He's got to look after himself now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_132.wav|He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_133.wav|No country has a similar training programme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_134.wav|There is no future in rock music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_135.wav|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_136.wav|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_137.wav|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_138.wav|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_139.wav|The programme has been made with great care.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_140.wav|There was only one living room, you see.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_141.wav|I am not under any new pressure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_142.wav|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_143.wav|It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_144.wav|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_145.wav|All eight victims were based in Germany.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_146.wav|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_147.wav|You should feel involved in their lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_148.wav|It is open season on the Old Firm.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_149.wav|Is it in the right place ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_150.wav|Did he trip ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_151.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_152.wav|Did it work ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_153.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_154.wav|Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_155.wav|Time may already have run out for this option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_156.wav|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_157.wav|When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_158.wav|They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_159.wav|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_160.wav|A progress report will be published in October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_161.wav|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_162.wav|That will reduce my chance of selection.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_163.wav|When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_164.wav|Surely it can't run for two years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_165.wav|But the game is still wide open.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_166.wav|It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_167.wav|However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_168.wav|I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_169.wav|We had to work very hard for our points.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_170.wav|That is a big risk at any price.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_171.wav|You need a long-term strategy in football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_172.wav|He said some things which were better left alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_173.wav|If successful, several records will be made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_174.wav|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_175.wav|It didn't come as any great surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_176.wav|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_177.wav|It's just a different way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_178.wav|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_179.wav|Nato has left them with no other option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_180.wav|I am secure in my own position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_181.wav|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_182.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_183.wav|The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_184.wav|We have come a long way since then.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_185.wav|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_186.wav|A great player has to win major championships.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_187.wav|Highland health board has a responsibility here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_188.wav|I didn't miss the big house at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_189.wav|The story was not made public by this club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_190.wav|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_191.wav|You are not long home from work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_192.wav|I am fighting the force of nature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_193.wav|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_194.wav|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_195.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_196.wav|was everything done to save people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_197.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_198.wav|But they had to be paid for.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_199.wav|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_200.wav|The police insisted that they were standard issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_201.wav|One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_202.wav|I've never had a year like this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_203.wav|Full details are expected to be released in June.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_204.wav|As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_205.wav|Hague will be leader at the election after next.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_206.wav|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_207.wav|I want an answer from the British Government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_208.wav|Gas production was also at record levels last year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_209.wav|They are a victim of their own success.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_210.wav|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_211.wav|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_212.wav|It is going to change the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_213.wav|Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_214.wav|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_215.wav|The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_216.wav|I am not going to judge them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_217.wav|I do not see this so much as failure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_218.wav|A European final must be the millennium target.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_219.wav|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_220.wav|I was independent but I am not now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_221.wav|We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_222.wav|We are still seeking that complete performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_223.wav|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_224.wav|Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_225.wav|The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_226.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_227.wav|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_228.wav|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_229.wav|I want to see as much progress as possible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_230.wav|This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_231.wav|I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_232.wav|The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_233.wav|They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_234.wav|The labour side has developed in the North area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_235.wav|You are not allowed to do that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_236.wav|That is the last thing they need.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_237.wav|He has worked for several years in the United States.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_238.wav|The children were later able to leave by bus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_239.wav|Jim was down there with his wife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_240.wav|Was it the wife ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_241.wav|Why change it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_242.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_243.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_244.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_245.wav|What are you not good at ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_246.wav|I think, therefore I am ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_247.wav|Church leaders warned other homes could close.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_248.wav|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_249.wav|My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_250.wav|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_251.wav|However, the figures tell a different story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_252.wav|The rise has come too late for some.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_253.wav|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_254.wav|I'd rather play well next week than here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_255.wav|Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_256.wav|The British Government should follow the Irish example.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_257.wav|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_258.wav|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_259.wav|Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_260.wav|And they never show the same film as a rival.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_261.wav|Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_262.wav|There would be a north and south division.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_263.wav|The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_264.wav|The two companies were not for sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_265.wav|His condition was described as serious last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_266.wav|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_267.wav|The board do not own the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_268.wav|Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_269.wav|They always want to give a performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_270.wav|Its primary business channel is the internet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_271.wav|That's been the difference between the sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_272.wav|The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_273.wav|I think I was about four years old.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_274.wav|Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_275.wav|It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_276.wav|Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_277.wav|I think the shares are good value.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_278.wav|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_279.wav|Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_280.wav|The life office will now stay with Abbey.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_281.wav|Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_282.wav|Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_283.wav|He may be ready for first team action in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_284.wav|The fans pay for their season tickets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_286.wav|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_287.wav|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_288.wav|No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_289.wav|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_290.wav|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_291.wav|He would get into any world team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_292.wav|Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_293.wav|They first met during a Step in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_294.wav|The agreement remains the only show in town.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_295.wav|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_296.wav|The strong performance is expected to continue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_297.wav|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_298.wav|It is based on population rather than need.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_299.wav|He could understand both points of view.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_300.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_301.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_302.wav|And does it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_303.wav|Are you from the rugby ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_304.wav|Had I heard ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_305.wav|What happened in that game ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_306.wav|Are you going to win ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_308.wav|Further heavy charges are expected this year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_309.wav|It happened on average once a week this year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_310.wav|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_311.wav|He is keen to stay in public service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_312.wav|Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_313.wav|For that reason cover should not be given.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_314.wav|He felt too close to head office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_315.wav|If you believe in the blue and white.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_316.wav|A report on their property is due within days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_317.wav|He will just go on doing his job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_318.wav|I always felt they played for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_319.wav|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_320.wav|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_321.wav|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_322.wav|We will not simply hit these people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_323.wav|We still think this trade is on the increase.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_324.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_325.wav|His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_326.wav|I feel as if I can hole everything now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_327.wav|I try to be open to experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_328.wav|He is not exactly a pretty child.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_329.wav|I thought the race was a little bit slow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_330.wav|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_331.wav|Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_332.wav|I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_333.wav|These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_334.wav|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_335.wav|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_336.wav|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_337.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_338.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_339.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_340.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_341.wav|Put another way, they just won't do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_342.wav|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_343.wav|Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_344.wav|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_345.wav|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_346.wav|It was a bit like having children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_347.wav|And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_348.wav|And that is the bottom line - box office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_349.wav|I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_350.wav|I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_352.wav|Sales will begin by the end of October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_353.wav|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_354.wav|Friday night was a pretty good night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_355.wav|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_356.wav|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_357.wav|It is the only natural British site on the list.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_358.wav|His style was direct and very human.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_359.wav|Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_360.wav|They have the cash and the fire power.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_361.wav|The institute board will take the decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_362.wav|He's young enough and he must learn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_363.wav|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_364.wav|Both players gave so much to the side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_365.wav|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_366.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_367.wav|The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_368.wav|It was a goal which came from nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_369.wav|We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_370.wav|I have come here to show support for the families.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_371.wav|We have been going for three years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_372.wav|He really played us into a corner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_373.wav|They know the truth, they really know the truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_374.wav|It was another black day for Ayrshire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_375.wav|Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_376.wav|It used to be all hard sell.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_377.wav|The direct effects on trade will be limited.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_378.wav|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_379.wav|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_380.wav|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_381.wav|This is not a small amount of money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_382.wav|The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_383.wav|I just felt that I was broken down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_384.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_385.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_386.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_387.wav|The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_388.wav|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_389.wav|He remains a main board director of Royal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_390.wav|His record on Government has always been highly effective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_391.wav|My tax affairs have been totally open.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_392.wav|Five years ago its return was rejected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_393.wav|But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_394.wav|In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_395.wav|In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_396.wav|We are keen to see truth and justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_397.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p243/p243_398.wav|People have a wish to charge twice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_025.wav|We are a service industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_026.wav|It may be good for the soul.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_027.wav|We want to lift the cup for the fans.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_028.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_029.wav|It is about investing in the future.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_030.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_031.wav|They were in good humour, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_032.wav|The end result is the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_033.wav|It is on the internet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_034.wav|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_035.wav|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_036.wav|This is a central issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_037.wav|History is in the making.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_038.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_039.wav|She was there for the start of the campaign.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_040.wav|She was at the top.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_041.wav|In London today, it was business as usual.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_042.wav|And they had a case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_043.wav|Something has to be put in place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_044.wav|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_045.wav|They are going after them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_046.wav|It is all about the story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_047.wav|The whole thing is the music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_048.wav|In fact, they are the future of investment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_049.wav|That is still the case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_050.wav|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_051.wav|In my view, it has to be done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_052.wav|The pressure on the players will build.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_053.wav|Their campaign is in disarray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_054.wav|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_055.wav|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_056.wav|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_057.wav|Clearly, they had other problems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_058.wav|This trend is likely to strengthen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_059.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_060.wav|We have got to deliver.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_061.wav|That was the difference today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_062.wav|The company continues to grow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_063.wav|He said it was for sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_064.wav|We felt it was sufficient.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_065.wav|That is all in the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_066.wav|There is a lot to be done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_067.wav|But that's another story for another day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_068.wav|He has not been dropped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_069.wav|It was an outstanding performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_070.wav|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_071.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_072.wav|It is only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_073.wav|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_074.wav|Only water is currently allowed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_075.wav|This time, it might be for real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_076.wav|She did that for the rest of her life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_077.wav|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_078.wav|That will be the office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_079.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_080.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_081.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_082.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_083.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_084.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_085.wav|It starts with the script.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_086.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_087.wav|It would have been around the turn of the century.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_088.wav|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_089.wav|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_090.wav|It seems a good thing to try.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_091.wav|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_092.wav|It sounds a lot of money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_093.wav|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_094.wav|It is not a story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_095.wav|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_096.wav|He is in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_097.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_098.wav|It took an option on the process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_099.wav|By then, he was walking on water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_100.wav|This is a game of confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_101.wav|On Saturday, it was much the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_102.wav|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_103.wav|The door is still open, but we need a bit of help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_104.wav|The trick is to try it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_105.wav|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_106.wav|Victory was never in doubt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_107.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_108.wav|On this occasion, the case for a public inquiry was not made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_109.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_110.wav|Then again, we could have.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_111.wav|There, you were just a body.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_112.wav|But he has not become a monster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_113.wav|He is not a dancer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_114.wav|We had planned to sell the property for some time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_115.wav|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_116.wav|In the end we have to take a stand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_117.wav|This is a sea change in approach.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_118.wav|Otherwise, the market may come back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_119.wav|The procedures were not in place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_120.wav|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_121.wav|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_122.wav|He was not alone at the top of the board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_123.wav|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_124.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_125.wav|We had a great time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_126.wav|I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_127.wav|According to criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_128.wav|It was far from business as usual.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_129.wav|He wanted to record the group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_130.wav|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_131.wav|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_132.wav|It is hard to believe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_133.wav|Or it would have been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_134.wav|Three days later, he was killed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_135.wav|Football is a passion for many.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_136.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_137.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_138.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_139.wav|And does it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_140.wav|Are you from the rugby ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_141.wav|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_142.wav|That was the first step.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_143.wav|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_144.wav|I have been in contact with him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_145.wav|Actors like to be in the centre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_146.wav|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_147.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_148.wav|I am the manager of Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_149.wav|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_150.wav|There were no grounds for his action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_151.wav|I can't even get into the A team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_152.wav|It starts at the top.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_153.wav|Others are expected to follow the lead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_154.wav|She does not want to speak.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_155.wav|It was all for good reason as well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_156.wav|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_157.wav|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_158.wav|As for the warning, it was not needed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_159.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_160.wav|We want to get there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_161.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_162.wav|There is a lack of staff.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_163.wav|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_164.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_165.wav|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_166.wav|At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_167.wav|Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_168.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_169.wav|Anyone can do the sums.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_170.wav|We have to create it in the playing strength of the team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_171.wav|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_172.wav|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_173.wav|We were all over the place in the first half.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_174.wav|Like the others, he was arrested.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_175.wav|All the pressure was on him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_176.wav|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_177.wav|They have not been named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_178.wav|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_179.wav|I think the Labour party is completely split on this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_180.wav|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_181.wav|I was always in control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_182.wav|It was by the numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_183.wav|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_184.wav|It should never have happened.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_185.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_186.wav|The feeling is hard to describe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_187.wav|It is difficult to say.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_188.wav|That is a question for the next manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_189.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_190.wav|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_191.wav|It is simply not true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_192.wav|Are you going to win ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_193.wav|Was it the wife ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_194.wav|Why change it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_195.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_196.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_197.wav|That you can do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_198.wav|I would like to continue to develop.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_199.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_200.wav|He has defended the system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_201.wav|We want to begin a programme in the UK.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_203.wav|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_204.wav|It is not an issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_205.wav|They have to get that sorted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_206.wav|We can take the city.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_207.wav|He played it like a veteran.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_208.wav|It was the story of the second half.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_209.wav|Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_210.wav|As many as the market will support.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_211.wav|He is believed to live in Britain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_212.wav|Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_213.wav|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_214.wav|This conference was never confirmed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_215.wav|A team is a team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_216.wav|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_217.wav|I'm interested in interesting work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_218.wav|It decided to blame the media.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_219.wav|THE force is with them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_220.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_221.wav|It was important to win today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_222.wav|He was not injured in the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_223.wav|Because he was born in England.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_224.wav|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_225.wav|Milk producers were in need of immediate assistance, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_226.wav|I was not overly concerned about this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_227.wav|However, it is not as simple as this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_228.wav|We want this place to work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_229.wav|It still has an effect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_230.wav|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_231.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_232.wav|Other villages were completely deserted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_233.wav|There is a lot of concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_234.wav|It will be decided in the next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_235.wav|We have to win the group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_236.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_237.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_238.wav|We have an election in eight days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_239.wav|There was a lot of resentment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_240.wav|This is a fight to the death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_241.wav|All will be revealed in due course.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_242.wav|He is a man of the people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_243.wav|The matter is under appeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_244.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_245.wav|was everything done to save people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_246.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_247.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_248.wav|Is it in the right place ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_249.wav|Did he trip ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_250.wav|Sadly, it could not be done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_251.wav|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_252.wav|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_253.wav|Instead, he missed the lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_254.wav|I was never in danger.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_255.wav|A lot has been written.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_256.wav|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_257.wav|It was really good in the first week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_258.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_259.wav|However, the ball refused to sit for the Frenchman.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_260.wav|That is not the case in Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_261.wav|But it was a loss.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_262.wav|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_263.wav|The performance continues to improve.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_264.wav|It expected this trend to continue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_265.wav|However, no further action was taken by police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_266.wav|It depends on Labour, not on us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_267.wav|But we were in control at that point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_268.wav|It has to be enforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_269.wav|The party has never fully recovered.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_270.wav|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_271.wav|But the government has so far failed to listen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_272.wav|He must have a crack at it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_273.wav|I am still waiting for a reply.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_274.wav|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_275.wav|He was good, but not that good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_276.wav|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_277.wav|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_278.wav|However, the matter is not going to end there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_279.wav|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_280.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_281.wav|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_282.wav|On a practical level, it would be difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_283.wav|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_284.wav|It is important that he is involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_285.wav|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_286.wav|It should be noted that he has been released without charge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_287.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_288.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_290.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_291.wav|None of the agencies was able to help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_292.wav|I didn't see the point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_293.wav|This idea has been around for four years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_294.wav|We are in a war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_295.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_296.wav|Is our children learning ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_297.wav|How independent is that ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_298.wav|What form did that take ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_299.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_300.wav|Scotland won by six wickets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_301.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_302.wav|This is a historic agreement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_303.wav|We have to be realistic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_304.wav|Every one is a winner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_305.wav|There was a hole in it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_306.wav|It will be done in stages.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_307.wav|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_308.wav|Every character was completely different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_309.wav|But it is a similar problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_310.wav|In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_311.wav|But it is important for a number of reasons.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_312.wav|In that moment, I was happy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_313.wav|All of the management has invested in the firm.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_314.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_315.wav|They were not at the property yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_316.wav|It involved the same people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_317.wav|We want to get back into the Champions League.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_318.wav|We have to be very, very careful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_319.wav|Look at the potential of this club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_320.wav|Hopefully, this week will be good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_321.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_322.wav|We did something about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_323.wav|But it is up again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_324.wav|However, the devil is in the detail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_325.wav|For the moment, however, the position is clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_326.wav|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_327.wav|He is already in place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_328.wav|Another difference is the cost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_329.wav|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_330.wav|And we can do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_331.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_333.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_334.wav|Tax is a matter for national governments.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_335.wav|And it's a goodbye from him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_336.wav|It is a sensitive issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_337.wav|They have to be addressed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_338.wav|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_339.wav|Like many companies, it is a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_340.wav|The business is mainly active in Europe, the US and Australia.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_341.wav|However, a bid was never made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_342.wav|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_343.wav|Something is going to have to give.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_344.wav|And the context is also completely different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_345.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_346.wav|The banking sector was weak.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_347.wav|But the New Year was special.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_348.wav|We never played at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_349.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_350.wav|This isn't the end of story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_351.wav|He is a great prospect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_352.wav|He has been told by the doctor to rest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_353.wav|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_354.wav|Of course, it does not have to be this way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_355.wav|This latter suggestion is very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_356.wav|However, it does not tell the full story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_357.wav|They were impressive against France.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_358.wav|The challenge is to win a cup.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_359.wav|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_360.wav|It was a test in itself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_361.wav|Either team will be hard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_362.wav|The parents will have a great time, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_363.wav|At first, the youngster was not keen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_364.wav|However, it has to be seen as part of a package.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_365.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_366.wav|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_367.wav|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_368.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_369.wav|However, it was well worth the wait.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_370.wav|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_371.wav|I have a good feeling about this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_372.wav|The news is not all bad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_373.wav|Some of the passing was a disgrace.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_374.wav|However, it does not seem to be the case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_375.wav|It is almost certain to be the last.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_376.wav|You have to be patient.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_377.wav|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_378.wav|I was delighted to accept.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_379.wav|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_380.wav|We are not going to fight in Kosovo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_381.wav|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_382.wav|It's fantastic to win again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_383.wav|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_384.wav|The company won the first round but lost on appeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_385.wav|Everything is in the mix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_386.wav|An announcement is expected this week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_387.wav|He will be difficult to replace.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_388.wav|I would be interested in another attempt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_389.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_390.wav|He was on a mission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_391.wav|Does it matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_392.wav|How do you take them away ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_393.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_394.wav|After the match, do you ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_395.wav|One-third of the places are already taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_396.wav|I understand the frustration of the fans.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_397.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_398.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_399.wav|I want this one to be different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_400.wav|It is the last meeting of the season.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_401.wav|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_402.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_403.wav|He is a quality player.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_404.wav|The service is expected to be introduced in December.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_405.wav|It's all been about the basics of the business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_406.wav|There is a demand for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_407.wav|It's great that it happened in Britain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_408.wav|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_409.wav|They are not going the length of the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_410.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_411.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_412.wav|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_413.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_414.wav|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_415.wav|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_416.wav|There is no need to panic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_417.wav|It had been on the cards.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_418.wav|However, he said the proposal was at an early stage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_419.wav|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_420.wav|That might mean another delay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_421.wav|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_422.wav|I am delighted for them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_423.wav|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p244/p244_424.wav|But it was a struggle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_016.wav|Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_025.wav|Johnson was pretty low.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_026.wav|But it failed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_027.wav|It's nice to hear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_028.wav|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_029.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_030.wav|They should be so lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_031.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_032.wav|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_033.wav|I was an athlete.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_034.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_035.wav|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_036.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_037.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_038.wav|It has failed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_039.wav|It was clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_040.wav|It's a great thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_041.wav|Indeed, he does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_042.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_043.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_044.wav|But it took a lot of bottle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_045.wav|Sure, it's funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_046.wav|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_047.wav|This represents a tough game for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_048.wav|We need to chat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_049.wav|The boy is no longer with us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_050.wav|Who can say?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_051.wav|It's a blessing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_053.wav|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_054.wav|They had to explain it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_055.wav|He had no enemies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_056.wav|Sadly, it can't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_057.wav|None has ever been found.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_058.wav|It's a matter of balance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_059.wav|There will be tough opponents to this report.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_060.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_061.wav|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_062.wav|He should have asked for a second opinion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_063.wav|He was popular.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_064.wav|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_065.wav|The script was funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_066.wav|You need a trademark.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_067.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_068.wav|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_069.wav|She died in hospital two hours later.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_070.wav|Is there a new way forward?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_071.wav|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_072.wav|People must remain vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_073.wav|This is the way things should be handled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_074.wav|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_075.wav|What has changed?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_076.wav|I'd like to continue that record.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_077.wav|That is bound to happen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_078.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_079.wav|We have other options.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_080.wav|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_081.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_082.wav|It's never too late.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_083.wav|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_084.wav|Now the system is right behind us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_085.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_086.wav|It is a lifeline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_087.wav|The reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_088.wav|Then came the crunch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_089.wav|If you could find it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_090.wav|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_091.wav|They were outside the circle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_092.wav|He's a star.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_093.wav|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_094.wav|We want to get to the final, anyway.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_095.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_096.wav|No date has been set for the appeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_097.wav|It was an adventure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_098.wav|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_099.wav|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_100.wav|I was angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_101.wav|That team is due to be announced this morning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_102.wav|I have had no social life at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_103.wav|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_104.wav|I'm delighted about that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_105.wav|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_106.wav|Who would be a referee?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_107.wav|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_108.wav|Who would have?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_109.wav|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_110.wav|We work on the same level.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_111.wav|I can't even get into the A team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_112.wav|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_113.wav|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_114.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_115.wav|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_116.wav|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_117.wav|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_118.wav|He has been under great pressure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_119.wav|Who will attend?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_120.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_121.wav|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_122.wav|What will happen then?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_123.wav|Is that it?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_124.wav|He was in a great deal of pain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_125.wav|We want to keep the pound.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_126.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_127.wav|There is a lack of chemistry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_128.wav|I was awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_129.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_130.wav|It is not just about pay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_131.wav|He will emerge as a world leader.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_132.wav|They did very well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_133.wav|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_134.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_135.wav|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_136.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_137.wav|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_138.wav|Mr Blair had done well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_139.wav|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_140.wav|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_141.wav|He can do no wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_142.wav|Was this element always there?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_143.wav|I've learned from my mistakes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_144.wav|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_145.wav|It has to be now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_146.wav|I was in the train station overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_147.wav|The release attracted little attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_148.wav|That will do for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_149.wav|Nobody did in those days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_150.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_151.wav|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_152.wav|It became a book by itself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_154.wav|We wanted it left for a wee while.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_155.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_156.wav|The hotel was now for sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_157.wav|I drove the ball well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_158.wav|Everyone can be bought.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_160.wav|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_161.wav|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_162.wav|They will run a mile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_163.wav|We did everything by the book.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_164.wav|It is not fair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_165.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_166.wav|I had a train to catch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_167.wav|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_168.wav|It is tough, but possible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_170.wav|The procedure is the same in all cases.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_171.wav|People will ask about us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_172.wav|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_173.wav|We must keep our feet on the ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_174.wav|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_175.wav|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_176.wav|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_177.wav|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_178.wav|It was still there, but right at the end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_179.wav|The conference is the first test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_180.wav|Is that success?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_181.wav|But we are not immune to the problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_182.wav|The red card was okay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_183.wav|I have a cold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_184.wav|They are in the euro.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_185.wav|He's not perfect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_186.wav|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_187.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_188.wav|It's all about money, money, money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_189.wav|That will be vital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_190.wav|Now, it's all right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_191.wav|It's like a garage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_192.wav|We don't even know his name.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_193.wav|Feel the heat?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_194.wav|He knows a lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_195.wav|I began to pray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_196.wav|I had decided to quit the show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_197.wav|His third goal was superb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_198.wav|It's been a good year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_199.wav|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_200.wav|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_201.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_202.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_203.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_204.wav|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_205.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_206.wav|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_207.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_208.wav|He demanded to speak to the boss.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_209.wav|You have to do your research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_210.wav|Saturday is gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_211.wav|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_212.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_213.wav|It was good fun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_214.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_215.wav|It's so special.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_216.wav|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_217.wav|I can't wait to meet him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_218.wav|My wife and family are the support system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_219.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_220.wav|They had no children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_221.wav|We are in the hat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_222.wav|We were a load of rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_223.wav|They should come forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_224.wav|It is not the message alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_225.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_226.wav|It's quite a line-up!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_227.wav|I might get an injury very easily.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_228.wav|This fact is supported by audience research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_229.wav|He was good, but not that good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_230.wav|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_231.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_232.wav|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_233.wav|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_234.wav|It's only fair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_235.wav|He says that he is no different from any other man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_236.wav|You can feel at home in China.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_237.wav|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_238.wav|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_239.wav|There wasn't a goal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_240.wav|I was shocked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_241.wav|They are different types.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_242.wav|It was a hit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_243.wav|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_244.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_245.wav|This year I understood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_246.wav|Her presence was almost everywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_247.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_248.wav|Is there on his hands?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_249.wav|I can't get a job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_250.wav|It is nearly there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_251.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_252.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_253.wav|It's that kind of place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_254.wav|they fail to engage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_256.wav|I was happily surprised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_257.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_258.wav|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_259.wav|I HAVE a dream.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_260.wav|It is set in Paris.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_261.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_262.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_263.wav|Immediate action must be taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_264.wav|It left me with a sadness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_265.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_266.wav|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_267.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_268.wav|Of course I was tempted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_269.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_270.wav|People have no choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_271.wav|She looked so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_272.wav|It happens from time to time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_273.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_274.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_275.wav|You've got to have both sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_276.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_277.wav|It was a virus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_278.wav|Yet, it worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_279.wav|It's very safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_280.wav|Well, he can do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_281.wav|He was obviously very genuine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_282.wav|It goes back a long way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_283.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_284.wav|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_285.wav|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_286.wav|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_287.wav|That could change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_288.wav|The goals will come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_289.wav|Sunday's game was not a trial.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_290.wav|This is a huge confidence boost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_291.wav|We have to sort it out ourselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_292.wav|He has retired.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_293.wav|There was no hint of scandal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_294.wav|I thought it was my only chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_295.wav|Nothing is safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_296.wav|They are wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_297.wav|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_298.wav|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_299.wav|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_301.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_302.wav|And he goes with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_303.wav|You are the glory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_304.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_306.wav|We have waited a long time for this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_307.wav|He was solid.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_310.wav|It also provides a wealth of contrast within the movement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_311.wav|I never thought it would take this long.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_312.wav|They wanted the club to make money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_313.wav|Craig is a major concern for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_314.wav|For the moment, our position remains the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_315.wav|They had a confession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_316.wav|I am very happy to be here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_317.wav|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_318.wav|There was no time scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_319.wav|My view has now completely changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_320.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_321.wav|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_322.wav|The boat was fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_323.wav|I saw some good things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_324.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_325.wav|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_326.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_329.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_330.wav|Who will do it?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_331.wav|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_332.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_333.wav|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_334.wav|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_335.wav|The train was on time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_336.wav|Action is needed now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_337.wav|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_338.wav|Indeed, it was magical.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_339.wav|I would miss him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_340.wav|There's no place to hide.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_344.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_345.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_346.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_347.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_349.wav|It is not like working for a living.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_350.wav|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_354.wav|It was very formal.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_356.wav|It's not that clear-cut.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p245/p245_359.wav|But nothing happened.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_025.wav|He has not been named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_026.wav|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_027.wav|Is this accurate?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_028.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_029.wav|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_030.wav|There's a story, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_031.wav|This is the window.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_032.wav|He was jailed for five years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_033.wav|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_034.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_035.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_036.wav|It has failed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_037.wav|They're just different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_038.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_039.wav|Indeed, he does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_040.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_041.wav|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_042.wav|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_043.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_044.wav|We will push.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_045.wav|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_046.wav|They said she was stable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_047.wav|Is a drug dealer?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_048.wav|There is no reason at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_049.wav|The State would provide.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_050.wav|She looked so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_051.wav|Every aspect of our play was first class.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_052.wav|Here's a clue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_053.wav|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_054.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_055.wav|It is unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_056.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_057.wav|That's the truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_058.wav|I feel I did not have enough time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_059.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_060.wav|Scotland had great assets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_061.wav|It's that kind of place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_062.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_063.wav|He could make it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_064.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_065.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_066.wav|The tournament has now been cancelled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_067.wav|There could be a way back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_068.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_069.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_070.wav|It is a job creation scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_071.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_072.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_073.wav|People must remain vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_074.wav|Today she has been released.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_075.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_076.wav|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_077.wav|He is in the queue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_078.wav|I first met him last summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_079.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_080.wav|A play is a set of actions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_081.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_082.wav|It is a blow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_083.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_084.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_085.wav|It will be tight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_086.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_087.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_088.wav|Tony Blair said as little.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_089.wav|As, indeed, they would be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_090.wav|This one did.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_091.wav|It was clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_092.wav|But I was wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_093.wav|It is home-grown.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_094.wav|I saw the whole thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_095.wav|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_096.wav|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_097.wav|They make a selective perception process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_098.wav|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_099.wav|No, the equipment is extra.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_100.wav|That would be unlawful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_101.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_102.wav|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_103.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_104.wav|It was an adventure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_105.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_106.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_107.wav|Is that right?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_108.wav|I had some time with Aston Villa.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_109.wav|It was the eighties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_110.wav|It is so sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_111.wav|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_112.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_113.wav|Who would be a referee?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_114.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_115.wav|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_116.wav|Who would have?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_117.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_118.wav|There were no grounds for his action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_119.wav|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_120.wav|She really suffered for her art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_121.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_122.wav|It is not a U-turn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_123.wav|I just wanted a break.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_124.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_125.wav|I am now unemployed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_126.wav|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_127.wav|It plans to return to this field.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_128.wav|It's perfectly feasible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_129.wav|We work well together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_130.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_131.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_132.wav|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_133.wav|My daughter is an adult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_134.wav|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_135.wav|It seems so long since I did the exams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_136.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_137.wav|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_138.wav|No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_139.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_140.wav|He realises his mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_141.wav|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_142.wav|I was awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_143.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_144.wav|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_145.wav|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_146.wav|It is not just about pay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_147.wav|I am just trying to do my job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_148.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_149.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_150.wav|I was stunned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_151.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_152.wav|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_153.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_154.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_155.wav|We are on a four-year mission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_156.wav|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_157.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_158.wav|I'd love to be like Peter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_159.wav|I will tell you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_160.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_161.wav|It is not like us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_162.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_163.wav|We have a budget in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_164.wav|Again, we were lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_165.wav|We should do everything at a stroke.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_166.wav|You had to go and see him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_167.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_168.wav|He was a crazy man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_169.wav|As we worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_170.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_171.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_172.wav|If that's the case, he will struggle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_173.wav|I drove the ball well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_174.wav|Tony had arrived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_175.wav|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_176.wav|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_177.wav|The goals were good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_178.wav|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_179.wav|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_180.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_181.wav|It's to do with context.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_182.wav|Does this matter?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_183.wav|One was a lawyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_184.wav|There is no openness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_185.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_186.wav|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_187.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_188.wav|It was very frightened and dirty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_189.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_190.wav|The concerns are the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_191.wav|Is that success?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_192.wav|I do not own the vessel in question.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_193.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_194.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_195.wav|Who will pay for this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_196.wav|They've got three-quarters of the way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_197.wav|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_198.wav|It's all about money, money, money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_199.wav|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_200.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_201.wav|I will win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_202.wav|Feel the heat?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_203.wav|He knows a lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_204.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_205.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_206.wav|I have decided to quit the show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_207.wav|My neighbours are horrified.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_208.wav|It's not ideal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_209.wav|In each case they were a goal down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_210.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_211.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_212.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_213.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_214.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_215.wav|The report is due out next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_216.wav|Because they didn't want to know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_217.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_218.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_219.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_220.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_221.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_222.wav|It's not before time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_223.wav|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_224.wav|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_225.wav|But she was.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_226.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_227.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_228.wav|My wife and family are the support system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_229.wav|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_230.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_231.wav|But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_232.wav|Of course I was tempted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_233.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_234.wav|You should be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_235.wav|It's quite nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_236.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_237.wav|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_238.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_239.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_240.wav|It is hard won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_241.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_242.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_243.wav|The scene is about this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_244.wav|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_245.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_246.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_247.wav|It was a hit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_248.wav|There's the mix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_249.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_250.wav|Is there on his hands?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_251.wav|I can't get a job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_252.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_253.wav|they fail to engage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_254.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_255.wav|Is that a serious question?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_256.wav|They must play for each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_257.wav|I could have got out a long time ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_258.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_259.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_260.wav|There's not much money in cycling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_261.wav|Souter will be back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_262.wav|Blood samples were taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_263.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_264.wav|It will be done in stages.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_265.wav|There is no link.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_266.wav|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_267.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_268.wav|We are happy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_270.wav|We're in shock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_271.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_272.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_273.wav|It's a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_274.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_275.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_276.wav|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_277.wav|They seem to get away with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_278.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_279.wav|It is so very obvious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_280.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_281.wav|It's so awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_282.wav|If not, he should go home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_283.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_284.wav|We are a grandmother.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_285.wav|But I've won both ways.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_286.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_287.wav|You feel very helpless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_288.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_289.wav|Dialogue is the key.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_290.wav|He will address the nation this evening.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_291.wav|It was a virus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_292.wav|Yet, it worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_293.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_294.wav|It was good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_295.wav|Bombing slaughter rejected
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_296.wav|We are not going to forget.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p246/p246_297.wav|No Briton has ever won.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_025.wav|They are very clever in their use of words.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_026.wav|Meetings will also remain private.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_027.wav|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_030.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_032.wav|It is not for any other purpose.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_040.wav|It is serious - but not that serious.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_041.wav|The boy is no longer with us.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_042.wav|They said she was stable.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_048.wav|It had little effect on European equity markets.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_049.wav|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_050.wav|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_051.wav|We would have concerns about suspension.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_052.wav|The couple actually came upon the accident.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_053.wav|The problems are a result of that shortfall.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_119.wav|This is a step backwards.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_120.wav|There's still plenty time left.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_121.wav|That might help a bit.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_122.wav|However, the problem is timing.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_123.wav|It isn't a happy memory.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_124.wav|We have the mental strength.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_133.wav|The answer was in space.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_134.wav|But it could be a consequence of our policy.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_135.wav|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_136.wav|This should begin in October.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_137.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_138.wav|We did what we had to do.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_139.wav|But it is different in different regions.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_140.wav|This is the highlight of my career.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_141.wav|They made such decisions in London.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_142.wav|I learned that only yesterday.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_143.wav|I have accepted the challenge.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_144.wav|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_153.wav|Does the name matter ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_154.wav|how do you get it back ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_155.wav|That is the ultimate revenge.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_156.wav|Before it was an ordeal.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_157.wav|I love the spectacle of cinema.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_158.wav|Anyone can do the sums.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_161.wav|His second goal was equally impressive.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_162.wav|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_163.wav|He's not a Celtic man.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_164.wav|That view has not altered.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_165.wav|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_166.wav|It has become a way of life.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_167.wav|There's always the next century.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_168.wav|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_169.wav|It is not normal practice.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_170.wav|Nothing was meant by it.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_171.wav|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_178.wav|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_179.wav|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_180.wav|They could not match it.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_304.wav|He will address the nation this evening.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_305.wav|Tony Blair said as little.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_306.wav|Motherwell have no such good fortune.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_307.wav|But it has been an amazing experience.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_308.wav|We would hope to make progress on that next year.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_309.wav|The rescue package is public money.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_310.wav|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_311.wav|The effect was almost magical.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_312.wav|I was there five months ago.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_314.wav|Britain is going to celebrate in style.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_315.wav|His job was not advertised.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_316.wav|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_317.wav|He was obviously very genuine.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_318.wav|The weather will be unpredictable if anything.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_319.wav|His appeal is instantly understood.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_320.wav|I first met him last summer.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_321.wav|A Home Office spokesman said.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_322.wav|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_323.wav|There was no hint of scandal.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_324.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_325.wav|His only reply was a laugh.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_326.wav|I thought his speech was a disgrace.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_327.wav|Job losses were also announced.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_328.wav|We believe the world has too many refugees already.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_329.wav|Investors can be forgiven for caution.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_330.wav|The party lasted all night.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_331.wav|This is a moment to seize.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_332.wav|They come to enjoy themselves.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_333.wav|The people will not be patient.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_334.wav|And he goes with it.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_335.wav|Scotland has shown the way.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_336.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_337.wav|We will listen to any suggestion.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_338.wav|It was an achievement all right.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_339.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_340.wav|The whole thing is utterly transparent.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_341.wav|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_342.wav|It is inherent in society.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_343.wav|Are they free ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_344.wav|What are they for ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_345.wav|Is there a waiting list ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_346.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_347.wav|So what happens next ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_348.wav|Had this been common practice ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_349.wav|What do they want us to do ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_350.wav|Is it worth it ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_351.wav|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_352.wav|There was some merit in that.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_353.wav|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_354.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_355.wav|But the New Year was special.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_356.wav|Other people had looked at it.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_357.wav|It was tough to contain the excitement.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_358.wav|The pain is still acute.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_359.wav|He said something in his work.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_360.wav|It's wonderful to have won.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_361.wav|Brian Wilson is a former Member to watch award winner.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_362.wav|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_363.wav|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_364.wav|But we welcome this document.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_365.wav|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_366.wav|He can handle it without any problem.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_367.wav|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_368.wav|I think we'll just keep it.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_369.wav|It is a stroke of genius.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_370.wav|He had no access to the database.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_371.wav|The members have voted against it.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_372.wav|He had no previous convictions.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_373.wav|Neither woman has been named.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_374.wav|I got a yellow card.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_375.wav|They have broken that promise.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_376.wav|That is a crazy situation.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_377.wav|Two things were clear from the new programme.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_378.wav|Yesterday was a statement of intent.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_379.wav|The group is not paying a dividend.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_380.wav|The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_381.wav|The major championships will always have a special place.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_382.wav|There is no deal as yet.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_383.wav|It's as wide as a church in here.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_384.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_385.wav|to have products for their needs.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_386.wav|The pair are very much in love.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_387.wav|The team hadn't been picked.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_388.wav|It benefits the whole family.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_389.wav|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_390.wav|Glasgow University declined to comment.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_391.wav|He will consult the right people.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_392.wav|Rugby has an extended run.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_393.wav|It has happened for generations.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_394.wav|Theatre is not a museum.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_395.wav|He took over our lives.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_396.wav|It seems a long time ago.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_397.wav|They have not done so this season so far.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_398.wav|It is a simple equation.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_399.wav|Ferguson must take the blame.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_400.wav|That investment has now been secured.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_401.wav|It proved a good decision.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_402.wav|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_403.wav|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_404.wav|The BBC was a disgrace.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_405.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_406.wav|But the foundations have been laid.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_407.wav|There was an element of frustration.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_408.wav|But they can also be managed by telephone.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_409.wav|The idea was first mooted a year ago.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_410.wav|The casualties were not named.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_411.wav|Does it matter ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_412.wav|How do you take them away ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_413.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_414.wav|After the match, do you ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_415.wav|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_416.wav|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_417.wav|Shelter also supports the reform.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_418.wav|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_419.wav|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_420.wav|That is not the position of the British relatives.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_421.wav|He seems to be used to the attention.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_422.wav|The projections are very positive for South Africa.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_423.wav|That's been all around Europe with me.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_424.wav|Surrey police said no body had been found.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_425.wav|It was submitted without their knowledge.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_426.wav|Being captain of this club is fantastic.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_427.wav|My aim is a top six finish.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_428.wav|A similar scheme is under way in central Scotland.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_429.wav|Such an attack is bizarre.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_430.wav|The success of the Open Eye has enabled the business to expand.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_431.wav|No date has been fixed for his return.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_432.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_433.wav|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_434.wav|No-one wanted to run it tonight.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_435.wav|It's going to be epic.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_436.wav|There is another important factor.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_437.wav|We've made a couple of albums.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_438.wav|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_439.wav|An alternative must be offered.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_440.wav|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_441.wav|There is no hiding place.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_442.wav|Their condition is described as satisfactory.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_443.wav|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_444.wav|The Allies intend to maintain the average.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_445.wav|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_446.wav|It wouldn't matter if he had.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_447.wav|That will be best for him.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_448.wav|There were no formal announcements.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_449.wav|He deserves a second chance.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_450.wav|It certainly appeared that way.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_451.wav|But you can go beyond that condition.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_452.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_453.wav|It could cause a little bit of disruption.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_454.wav|Police have appealed for witnesses.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_455.wav|People are so negative about the whole business.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_456.wav|Discussions will continue with the industry in Scotland.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_457.wav|It recommended that they reject the proposed legislation.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_458.wav|It might be useful to have something in black and white.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_459.wav|The damage is all inside.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_460.wav|The boys are mentally focused.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_461.wav|It's because they can't understand the language.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_462.wav|Then came the farewell to Europe.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_463.wav|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_464.wav|I'm very passionate about my country.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_465.wav|Phil Mickelson did that last year.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_466.wav|I think it's a great system.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_467.wav|They're just a good retailer.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_468.wav|That should get their attention.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_469.wav|Now that business is banned.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_470.wav|They were good years for him.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_471.wav|At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_472.wav|And it covers the spectrum.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_473.wav|We will now look into its historical background.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_474.wav|They were impressive against France.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_475.wav|The chief constable has retired.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_476.wav|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_477.wav|The casting of her husband was an accident.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p247/p247_479.wav|That was the first time I worked with Richard.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_025.wav|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_026.wav|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_027.wav|But it failed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_028.wav|That's no bad thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_029.wav|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_030.wav|I have a theory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_031.wav|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_032.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_033.wav|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_034.wav|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_035.wav|I expected these kind of questions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_036.wav|It's a matter of balance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_037.wav|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_038.wav|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_039.wav|It was clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_040.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_041.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_042.wav|I was scared.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_043.wav|It was ugly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_044.wav|That is a break with tradition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_045.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_046.wav|No meaningful response was issued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_047.wav|It is urgent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_048.wav|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_049.wav|The record companies have gone through the floor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_050.wav|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_051.wav|But it might have done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_052.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_053.wav|He looks like an Afghan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_054.wav|They had to explain it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_055.wav|Here's a clue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_056.wav|But the law is very clear on this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_057.wav|Next league matches Celtic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_058.wav|It's very odd.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_059.wav|It will take time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_060.wav|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_061.wav|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_062.wav|Four other charges were dropped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_063.wav|It is not great art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_064.wav|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_065.wav|Scotland had great assets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_066.wav|There will be tough opponents to this report.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_067.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_068.wav|It's good news and long overdue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_069.wav|Have a look at our accounts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_070.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_071.wav|There was an e-mail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_072.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_073.wav|Neither it is.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_074.wav|I had my suspicions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_075.wav|He got the same story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_076.wav|It works for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_077.wav|It is a time bomb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_078.wav|Today she has been released.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_079.wav|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_080.wav|It may well have been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_081.wav|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_082.wav|Nothing is yet confirmed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_083.wav|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_084.wav|We have other options.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_085.wav|By then, he was walking on water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_086.wav|It's never too late.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_087.wav|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_088.wav|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_089.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_090.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_091.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_092.wav|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_093.wav|He was possessed
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_094.wav|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_095.wav|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_096.wav|It is a delight on every level.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_097.wav|I had a ball today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_098.wav|Two of the team became ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_099.wav|That's all right then.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_100.wav|That would be unlawful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_101.wav|That time is not now, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_102.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_103.wav|I didn't play well last year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_104.wav|That is no use.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_105.wav|That all hope is never lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_106.wav|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_107.wav|He pleaded for caution.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_108.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_109.wav|I thought it was a fantastic game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_110.wav|It had been played at festivals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_111.wav|We do not expect any surplus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_112.wav|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_113.wav|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_114.wav|It's not a new concept in jazz.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_115.wav|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_116.wav|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_117.wav|Maybe this battle has been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_118.wav|But the fans deserve to know!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_119.wav|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_120.wav|They've got to account for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_121.wav|She's got to say something.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_122.wav|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_123.wav|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_124.wav|I can't even get into the A team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_125.wav|She does not want to speak.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_126.wav|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_127.wav|So the European elections are extremely important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_128.wav|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_129.wav|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_130.wav|I had relied on him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_131.wav|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_132.wav|It's the big omission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_133.wav|It plans to return to this field.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_134.wav|Our intentions are real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_135.wav|Government will intervene.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_136.wav|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_137.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_138.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_139.wav|It was typical.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_140.wav|I was the last man to touch the ball.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_141.wav|He has the edge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_142.wav|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_143.wav|It's a crucial award.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_144.wav|He is severe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_145.wav|There is a lack of chemistry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_146.wav|This film will be totally awesome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_147.wav|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_148.wav|It is like a football team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_149.wav|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_150.wav|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_151.wav|It is huge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_152.wav|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_153.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_154.wav|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_155.wav|They were later discharged from hospital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_156.wav|That includes the equipment?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_157.wav|They should stop the bombing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_158.wav|That's the name of the game, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_159.wav|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_160.wav|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_161.wav|Eight months later, he was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_162.wav|It has to be now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_163.wav|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_164.wav|I was in the train station overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_165.wav|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_166.wav|It's that sort of night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_167.wav|We have a budget in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_168.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_169.wav|The post will be unpaid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_170.wav|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_171.wav|Waiting times for these services are too long.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_172.wav|They thought they had found a home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_173.wav|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_174.wav|The jury is still out.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_175.wav|Blair's response was weak.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_176.wav|IT S the real thing, for sure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_177.wav|And I saw the light!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_178.wav|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_179.wav|Tony had arrived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_180.wav|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_181.wav|The goals were good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_182.wav|I've been there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_183.wav|Four policemen were wounded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_184.wav|They receive a high profile in the media.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_185.wav|We did everything by the book.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_186.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_187.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_188.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_189.wav|You know the sort of thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_190.wav|I cannot say too much about them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_191.wav|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_192.wav|All options are open.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_193.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_194.wav|However, this idea is never developed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_195.wav|It wasn't to be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_196.wav|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_197.wav|It's the same old story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_198.wav|It was still there, but right at the end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_199.wav|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_200.wav|The service from the other players was super.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_201.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_202.wav|But she might be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_203.wav|It's just awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_204.wav|Today was first class.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_205.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_206.wav|We have an election in eight days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_207.wav|Now, it's all right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_208.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_209.wav|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_210.wav|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_211.wav|He is slightly confused.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_212.wav|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_213.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_214.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_215.wav|In each case they were a goal down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_216.wav|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_217.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_218.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_219.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_220.wav|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_221.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_222.wav|A career as a doctor is on hold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_223.wav|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_224.wav|It was good fun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_225.wav|I have spoken to the skipper.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_226.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_227.wav|The track is currently covered in snow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_228.wav|But he failed to win the committee's support.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_229.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_230.wav|It's the same as Glasgow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_231.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_232.wav|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_233.wav|It is set in Paris.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_234.wav|They should come forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_235.wav|I haven't made the donation yet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_236.wav|It's very safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_237.wav|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_238.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_239.wav|It is no surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_240.wav|My future is in the marathon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_241.wav|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_242.wav|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_243.wav|She is well balanced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_244.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_245.wav|It is hard won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_246.wav|The scene is about this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_247.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_248.wav|It's a record label, not a form of music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_249.wav|It was a cry for help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_250.wav|It was a hit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_251.wav|This year I understood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_252.wav|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_253.wav|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_254.wav|We run within the law.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_255.wav|Kirkwood was arrested.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_256.wav|they fail to engage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_257.wav|They are real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_258.wav|They must play for each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_259.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_260.wav|It is also very valuable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_261.wav|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_262.wav|That is highly unfair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_263.wav|He will emerge as a world leader.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_264.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_265.wav|This is a question of Islam.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_266.wav|Of course, that is not the whole story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_267.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_268.wav|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_269.wav|Immediate action must be taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_270.wav|He is a young man with a new deal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_271.wav|He was also married with two children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_272.wav|He's been here on numerous occasions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_273.wav|It's a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_274.wav|I feel pretty good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_275.wav|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_276.wav|If not, he should go home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_277.wav|He looked very sharp.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_278.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_279.wav|You've got to have both sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_280.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_281.wav|He will address the nation this evening.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_282.wav|It was a virus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_283.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_284.wav|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_285.wav|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_286.wav|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_287.wav|It is not normal practice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_288.wav|The release attracted little attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_289.wav|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_290.wav|IT S all in the hair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_291.wav|What has altered?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_292.wav|I thought it was my only chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_293.wav|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_294.wav|Our task is to complete the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_295.wav|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_296.wav|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_297.wav|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_298.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_299.wav|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_300.wav|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_301.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_302.wav|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_303.wav|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_304.wav|We have waited a long time for this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_305.wav|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_306.wav|It's about my time as a guitarist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_307.wav|It should be equal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_308.wav|Craig is a major concern for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_309.wav|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_310.wav|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_311.wav|Other people had looked at it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_312.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_313.wav|Off with their heads.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_314.wav|The parents will have a great time, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_315.wav|Donald was his friend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_316.wav|I think I was recorded with a video camera.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_317.wav|He was unable to come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_318.wav|I saw some good things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_319.wav|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_320.wav|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_321.wav|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_322.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_323.wav|Who will do it?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_324.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_325.wav|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_326.wav|This is the way things should be handled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_327.wav|The train was on time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_328.wav|You were very proud that day to be among their friends.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_329.wav|He has to learn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_330.wav|Indeed, it was magical.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_331.wav|There's no place to hide.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_332.wav|It will be very, very tight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_333.wav|I said that I had been raped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_334.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_335.wav|The composer will conduct.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_336.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_337.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_338.wav|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_339.wav|It's the last thing on my mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_340.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_341.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_342.wav|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_343.wav|It is horrible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_344.wav|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_345.wav|I kept going for her.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_346.wav|Tyson is overwhelmed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_347.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_348.wav|But nothing happened.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_349.wav|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_350.wav|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_351.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_352.wav|He has seen the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_353.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_354.wav|It was that bad, that low.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_355.wav|That would help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_356.wav|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_357.wav|Who was the mystery MP?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_358.wav|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_359.wav|He later became a respected High Court judge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_360.wav|He could face a jail sentence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_361.wav|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_362.wav|Now, though, he has an incentive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_363.wav|They have not done so this season so far.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_364.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_365.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_366.wav|It is legally binding.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_367.wav|Well, the big day has arrived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_368.wav|Five members were disciplined.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_369.wav|There is no signature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_370.wav|I am a wealthy person.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_371.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_372.wav|Colour was at the core of his life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_373.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_374.wav|He's a lovely young man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_375.wav|The casualties were not named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p248/p248_376.wav|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_025.wav|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_026.wav|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_027.wav|It's nice to hear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_028.wav|They should be so lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_029.wav|Because we do not need it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_030.wav|There's a story, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_031.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_032.wav|He took me on a tour of the wards.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_033.wav|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_034.wav|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_035.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_036.wav|It was clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_037.wav|It is not for any other purpose.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_038.wav|He did not know his daughter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_039.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_040.wav|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_041.wav|Sure, it's funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_042.wav|It's a crucial award.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_043.wav|The boy is no longer with us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_044.wav|It's a blessing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_045.wav|Is a drug dealer?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_046.wav|As she explains.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_047.wav|He is too weak to move.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_048.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_049.wav|I would love to have him home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_050.wav|He looks like an Afghan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_051.wav|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_052.wav|It will come all right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_053.wav|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_054.wav|Next league matches Celtic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_055.wav|It happens from time to time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_056.wav|It's very odd.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_057.wav|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_058.wav|It is unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_059.wav|It will take time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_060.wav|That's the truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_061.wav|Jobs could go.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_062.wav|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_063.wav|I'm just enjoying every match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_064.wav|And a film maker was born.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_065.wav|You did not change overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_066.wav|There was a battle there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_067.wav|Scotland had great assets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_068.wav|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_069.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_070.wav|Have a look at our accounts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_071.wav|It is like a river running by my home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_072.wav|Try to save us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_073.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_074.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_075.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_076.wav|The play is based on a real-life event.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_077.wav|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_078.wav|He highlighted a lack of staff.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_079.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_080.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_081.wav|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_082.wav|It is a job creation scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_083.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_084.wav|I've not thought about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_086.wav|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_087.wav|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_088.wav|She had kept the news from him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_089.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_090.wav|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_092.wav|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_093.wav|And rugby fans can help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_094.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_095.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_096.wav|Now the system is right behind us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_097.wav|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_098.wav|Today I couldn't run on it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_099.wav|However, it did not end that way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_100.wav|We must look forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_101.wav|It is an old family habit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_102.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_103.wav|Until you hit the big games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_104.wav|Then came the crunch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_105.wav|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_106.wav|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_107.wav|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_108.wav|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_109.wav|It is a good day for the coalition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_110.wav|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_111.wav|We want to get to the final, anyway.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_112.wav|It is a good lifestyle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_113.wav|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_114.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_115.wav|You had better believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_116.wav|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_117.wav|It's a long process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_118.wav|They were behind the wheel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_119.wav|It was ugly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_120.wav|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_121.wav|This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_122.wav|Does this mean.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_123.wav|They've got to account for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_124.wav|Who would have?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_125.wav|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_126.wav|You can spend money on housing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_127.wav|There were no grounds for his action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_128.wav|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_129.wav|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_130.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of a nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_131.wav|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_132.wav|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_133.wav|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_134.wav|We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_135.wav|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_136.wav|What will happen then?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_137.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_138.wav|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_139.wav|It was very frightened and dirty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_140.wav|I was the last man to touch the ball.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_141.wav|It's a question of fashion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_142.wav|We need to chat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_143.wav|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_144.wav|He is severe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_145.wav|It is difficult for Ali.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_146.wav|Is that Titanic?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_147.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_148.wav|The idea is simple.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_149.wav|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_150.wav|It is like a football team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_152.wav|It is not just about pay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_153.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_154.wav|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_155.wav|The weaknesses are few.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_156.wav|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_157.wav|It is not normal practice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_159.wav|It was by the numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_160.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_161.wav|There's a pause.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_162.wav|Neither side can win this war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_163.wav|They should stop the bombing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_164.wav|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_165.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_166.wav|It is an attitude of mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_167.wav|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_168.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_169.wav|They say that vital evidence was not heard in the court.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_170.wav|I'm so worried about the roads.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_171.wav|We have to move forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_172.wav|Tell it like it was?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_173.wav|It is not too late to get on board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_174.wav|We have a budget in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_176.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_177.wav|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_178.wav|The release attracted little attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_179.wav|Someone who cares
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_180.wav|I always felt they played for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_181.wav|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_182.wav|The jury is still out.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_183.wav|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_184.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_185.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_186.wav|It should be easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_187.wav|Everyone can be bought.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_188.wav|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_189.wav|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_190.wav|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_191.wav|It is not fair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_192.wav|Miller was every bit as happy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_193.wav|We want to help them through it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_194.wav|I put the drawing down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_196.wav|I had a train to catch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_197.wav|It is tough, but possible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_198.wav|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_199.wav|However, this idea is never developed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_200.wav|Last night was a key episode.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_201.wav|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_202.wav|It is a case of taking a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_203.wav|I wanted to put myself on the line.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_204.wav|Sir Paul McCartney said he had been shocked by the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_205.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_206.wav|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_207.wav|The service from the other players was super.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_208.wav|He has a lot of experience as a captain in his career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_209.wav|I have a cold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_210.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_211.wav|Ferguson should take note.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_212.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_213.wav|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_214.wav|It's all about money, money, money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_216.wav|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_217.wav|This is a good move for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_218.wav|But I am a worried man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_219.wav|There was an e-mail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_220.wav|Feel the heat?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_221.wav|We'll have to work hard today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_222.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_223.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_224.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_225.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_226.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_229.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_230.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_231.wav|It is a gamble.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_232.wav|My neighbours are horrified.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_234.wav|He is in the queue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_235.wav|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_236.wav|Broke the birdie record.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_237.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_238.wav|We were a load of rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_239.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_240.wav|It's a lovely, lovely film.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_241.wav|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_243.wav|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_244.wav|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_245.wav|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_246.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_247.wav|There wasn't a goal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_248.wav|I was shocked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_249.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_251.wav|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_252.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_253.wav|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_254.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_255.wav|It is very important that we get the balance right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_256.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_257.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_258.wav|They must play for each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_259.wav|His contract was then not renewed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_260.wav|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_261.wav|That's the only thing I will say.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_262.wav|Blood samples were taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_263.wav|They are never here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_265.wav|He has not created a Festival resource.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_266.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_267.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_268.wav|It is the same in Sweden.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_269.wav|And Michael was just great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_270.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_271.wav|It's not even finished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_272.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_273.wav|Things can change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_274.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_275.wav|People have no choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_276.wav|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_277.wav|He has a wealth of experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_278.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_279.wav|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_280.wav|There's nothing I can say.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_281.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_282.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_283.wav|You've got to have both sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_284.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_285.wav|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_286.wav|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_287.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_288.wav|Scotland were beaten again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_289.wav|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_290.wav|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_291.wav|These figures are truly awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_292.wav|He should have won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_293.wav|Sunday's game was not a trial.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_294.wav|A new school will be built.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_295.wav|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_296.wav|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_297.wav|What has altered?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_298.wav|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_299.wav|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_300.wav|Our task is to complete the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_301.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_302.wav|They are wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_303.wav|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_304.wav|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_305.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_306.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_307.wav|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_308.wav|And he goes with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_309.wav|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_310.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_311.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_312.wav|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_313.wav|Is there on his hands?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_314.wav|Special measures were needed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_315.wav|They were fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_316.wav|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_317.wav|They wanted the club to make money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_318.wav|The problems began a long time ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_319.wav|Referees are easy targets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_320.wav|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_321.wav|I came into this world with nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_322.wav|That's the law of the land.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_323.wav|There was no time scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_324.wav|I am so upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_326.wav|It could have gone either way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_327.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_328.wav|My view has now completely changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_329.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_330.wav|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_331.wav|The same things will happen with GM foods.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_332.wav|Who will do it?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_335.wav|I must make that clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_336.wav|The train was on time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_337.wav|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_338.wav|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_339.wav|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_340.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_341.wav|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_342.wav|He's a genius.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_343.wav|They should take their mobile phones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_344.wav|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_345.wav|Eight months later, he was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_347.wav|It's all going to clear the debt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_348.wav|He had played well in that central role.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_349.wav|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_350.wav|It is horrible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_351.wav|It was very formal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_352.wav|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_353.wav|I kept going for her.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p249/p249_354.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_025.wav|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_026.wav|Meetings will also remain private.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_027.wav|I am pretty careful with money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_028.wav|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_030.wav|This is a central issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_031.wav|We will not tolerate it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_032.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_033.wav|He works at the airport.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_034.wav|Smoking is also very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_035.wav|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_036.wav|It was just appalling luck.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_037.wav|Rugby has an extended run.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_038.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_039.wav|Costs have got to be controlled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_040.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_042.wav|No meaningful response was issued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_043.wav|This represents a tough game for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_044.wav|I made a terrible start.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_045.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_046.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_047.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_048.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_049.wav|It comes from reflection or thinking.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_050.wav|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_051.wav|Strikers like to go to the ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_052.wav|Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_053.wav|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_054.wav|I had trouble with the producers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_055.wav|The teacher would have approved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_056.wav|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_057.wav|I expect a rapid response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_058.wav|She said she was really sorry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_059.wav|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_060.wav|There's still plenty time left.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_061.wav|Let's hope that it does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_062.wav|We have to keep our clients.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_063.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_064.wav|Companies are now seeking to recover their losses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_065.wav|This is the first step.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_066.wav|We will pay their bills.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_067.wav|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_068.wav|The Farmer wants a new campaign.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_069.wav|Only water is currently allowed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_070.wav|I am about protecting the state pension.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_072.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_073.wav|It wasn't possible to relax.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_074.wav|We need to increase the membership.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_075.wav|There's nothing they can get on me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_076.wav|I was as strong as a horse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_077.wav|He was a lovely man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_078.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_079.wav|We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_080.wav|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_081.wav|It makes for an interesting conference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_082.wav|I've had it for the exams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_083.wav|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_084.wav|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_085.wav|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_086.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_087.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_088.wav|Potions said he would drive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_089.wav|I think the industry needs a big idea to rebuild confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_090.wav|William Hague, the guest of honour, was delighted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_091.wav|We are progressing with a few interested parties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_092.wav|That view is held by many others within the industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_093.wav|The excitement could hardly be contained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_094.wav|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_095.wav|It is high time to act.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_096.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_097.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_098.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_099.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_100.wav|And does it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_101.wav|Are you from the rugby ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_102.wav|Had I heard ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_103.wav|It is an old family habit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_104.wav|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_105.wav|He was released after treatment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_106.wav|We have made no final decisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_107.wav|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_108.wav|We knew they could do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_109.wav|The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_110.wav|They must be on commission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_111.wav|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_113.wav|Mr Wilson has received no such request.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_114.wav|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_115.wav|It's good to have a voice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_116.wav|He was prepared for this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_117.wav|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_118.wav|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_119.wav|No, the equipment is extra.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_120.wav|It didn't come as any great surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_121.wav|Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_123.wav|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_124.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_125.wav|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_126.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_127.wav|I understand the medical concerns.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_128.wav|That's not an assumption that I had made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_129.wav|I have learned from him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_130.wav|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_131.wav|He thought she was amazing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_132.wav|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_133.wav|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_134.wav|It isn't a happy memory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_135.wav|We have a team to reach the final.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_136.wav|Failure is not an option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_137.wav|She's got to say something.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_138.wav|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_139.wav|This is a frightening development.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_140.wav|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_141.wav|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_142.wav|That is far too high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_143.wav|My life has changed a lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_144.wav|We did what we had to do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_146.wav|You've got to be vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_147.wav|You are a gambling man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_148.wav|I had decided to quit the show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_149.wav|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_150.wav|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_151.wav|I love the spectacle of cinema.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_152.wav|We will try to find someone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_153.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_154.wav|What happened in that game ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_155.wav|Are you going to win ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_156.wav|Was it the wife ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_157.wav|Why change it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_158.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_159.wav|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_160.wav|He was pleased with his display.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_161.wav|Life is still very tough for them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_162.wav|It is not just about pay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_163.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_164.wav|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_165.wav|It has become a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_166.wav|The whole industry is a shambles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_167.wav|People were actually not on his side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_168.wav|The defender made an impressive debut.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_169.wav|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_170.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_171.wav|They have not been named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_172.wav|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_173.wav|Yesterday Abbey National said it had injected further capital into Scottish Provident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_174.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_175.wav|He was asked to quit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_176.wav|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_177.wav|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_178.wav|I'd love to be like Peter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_179.wav|You will be very welcome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_180.wav|It had so much to do with output.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_181.wav|That would open the gates of hell.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_182.wav|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_183.wav|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_184.wav|They could not match it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_185.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_186.wav|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_187.wav|This championship is different from the other majors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_188.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_189.wav|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_190.wav|The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_191.wav|Our fans have been marvellous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_192.wav|This could be an amazing attraction for Glasgow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_193.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_194.wav|Miller was every bit as happy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_195.wav|They were seriously after him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_196.wav|It was a bit like having children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_197.wav|Aberdeen had little to offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_198.wav|We represent a wide range of society.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_199.wav|He was rejected because he had retired.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_200.wav|We always felt we could win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_201.wav|It may have been a cry for help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_202.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_204.wav|We are going through difficult times.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_205.wav|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_206.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_207.wav|You could feel the heat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_208.wav|We have to be happy with a British and European record.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_209.wav|It was a moment of madness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_210.wav|And we have the experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_211.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_212.wav|It gave no further details.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_214.wav|I won't make an official complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_215.wav|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_216.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_217.wav|The move follows a review of the Singapore
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_218.wav|It carried a double message.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_219.wav|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_220.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_221.wav|That might help a bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_222.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_223.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_224.wav|What are you not good at ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_225.wav|I think, therefore I am ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_226.wav|Who was she ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_227.wav|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_228.wav|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_229.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_230.wav|My daughter is an adult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_231.wav|His third goal was superb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_232.wav|It will affect their work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_233.wav|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_234.wav|I am considered a teenager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_235.wav|The process will start tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_236.wav|It's just a normal life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_237.wav|The transaction is not feasible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_238.wav|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_239.wav|It is good for our team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_240.wav|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_241.wav|That you can do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_242.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_243.wav|A career as a doctor is on hold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_244.wav|During the communist time they were very privileged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_245.wav|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_246.wav|His background is firmly in venture capital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_247.wav|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_248.wav|I have spoken to the skipper.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_249.wav|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_250.wav|She will attend in July.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_251.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_252.wav|The most important thing is the game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_253.wav|There is no timetable for completing such inquiries.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_254.wav|Paterson can afford to be generous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_255.wav|The right decision has been made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_257.wav|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_258.wav|Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_260.wav|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_261.wav|He was good, but not that good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_262.wav|At half-time he was presented to both teams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_263.wav|He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_264.wav|He is a reporter for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_265.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_266.wav|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_267.wav|We've had several problems over injuries.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_268.wav|That was a disgraceful performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_269.wav|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_270.wav|It was a kind of contempt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_271.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_272.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_273.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_274.wav|Messages have to be reinforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_275.wav|I got a yellow card.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_276.wav|This is no reflection on Rangers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_277.wav|We accept the new rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_278.wav|They are interior designers and architects.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_280.wav|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_281.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_282.wav|We are aiming for early March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_283.wav|I felt about this big.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_284.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_285.wav|was everything done to save people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_286.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_287.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_288.wav|Is it in the right place ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_289.wav|It is also very valuable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_290.wav|I feel really confident in that department.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_291.wav|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_292.wav|Companies have only recently been allowed to compete on price.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_293.wav|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_294.wav|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_295.wav|We shall rely on human beings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_296.wav|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_297.wav|We would have no control over the threshold for repayment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_298.wav|He has not created a Festival resource.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_299.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_300.wav|I understand the security issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_301.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_302.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_304.wav|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_305.wav|Funding would come from both Scotland and Northern Ireland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_306.wav|No-one wanted to run it tonight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_308.wav|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_309.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_310.wav|You have to expect this type of thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_311.wav|Stephen will get his first cap.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_312.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_313.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_314.wav|The circumstances have changed since last year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_315.wav|It's all designed to speed up the service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_316.wav|I wanted to change the formula.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_317.wav|He will address the nation this evening.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_318.wav|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_319.wav|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_320.wav|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_321.wav|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_322.wav|The effect was almost magical.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_323.wav|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_324.wav|Holland won by five wickets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_325.wav|There's still no-one like him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_326.wav|McNaughton was not so sure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_327.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_328.wav|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_329.wav|The takeover comes as no surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_330.wav|Job losses were also announced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_331.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_332.wav|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_333.wav|The party lasted all night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_334.wav|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_335.wav|It was nice to finish in style.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_336.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_337.wav|Completion of the purchase is seen by the end of the year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_338.wav|And he goes with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_339.wav|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_340.wav|There will be good prospects ahead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_341.wav|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_342.wav|The letters are going out today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_343.wav|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_344.wav|We will listen to any suggestion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_345.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_346.wav|He has made his base in Spain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_348.wav|A Home Office spokesman said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_349.wav|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_350.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_351.wav|It was tough to contain the excitement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_352.wav|The pain is still acute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_353.wav|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_354.wav|It's wonderful to have won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_355.wav|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_356.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_357.wav|Finally came the moment of truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_358.wav|We have very limited capacity.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_359.wav|Is our children learning ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_360.wav|What form did that take ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_361.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_362.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_363.wav|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_364.wav|Three years ago he would have been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_365.wav|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_366.wav|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_367.wav|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_368.wav|We put our bid in last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_369.wav|He had no access to the database.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_370.wav|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_371.wav|I was delighted to accept.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_372.wav|They should take their mobile phones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_374.wav|It's fantastic to win again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_375.wav|We are really good friends.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_376.wav|The salary changes are long overdue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_377.wav|Those people must be accountable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_378.wav|She said they would appeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_379.wav|The countryside is in crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_380.wav|There is no deal as yet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_381.wav|It's as wide as a church in here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_382.wav|She is obviously very disappointed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_383.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_384.wav|They will fight for everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_385.wav|We will win the argument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_386.wav|Is it worth it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_387.wav|Does it matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_388.wav|How do you take them away ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_389.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_390.wav|After the match, do you ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_391.wav|The team hadn't been picked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_392.wav|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_393.wav|One-third of the places are already taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_394.wav|I always knew she was funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_395.wav|Everyone could see the joke.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_396.wav|The marshall at the turn was great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_397.wav|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_398.wav|He has earned the right to their respect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_399.wav|The law would appear to be on our side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_400.wav|There was a substantial explosion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_401.wav|The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_402.wav|Theatre is not a museum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_403.wav|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_404.wav|It has only been rumours.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_405.wav|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_406.wav|Rugby is a hard game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_407.wav|My immune system had been depleted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_408.wav|Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_409.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_410.wav|Growth will come later in the cycle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_411.wav|We're not taking any risks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_412.wav|Neither man has been charged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_413.wav|I had a fortunate war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_414.wav|The choice is strictly personal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_415.wav|It's too close to call.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_416.wav|The breakdown was much later in her life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_417.wav|It became a national network.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_418.wav|It is a large number.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_419.wav|She started to put on weight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_420.wav|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_421.wav|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_422.wav|The BBC was a disgrace.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_423.wav|Russell is delighted with them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_424.wav|The next few months will tell.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_425.wav|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_426.wav|The second goal was superb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_427.wav|I am astonished at attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_428.wav|There is a solution, she believes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_429.wav|That was the agreement with the manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_430.wav|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_431.wav|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_432.wav|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_433.wav|First Minister Donald Dewar will respond.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_434.wav|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_435.wav|No date has been fixed for his return.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_436.wav|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_437.wav|The trial will open today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_438.wav|National Farmer's Union of Scotland president, Jim Walker, welcomed the new proposals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_439.wav|I never won a penny throughout my career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_440.wav|THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_441.wav|There were a lot of emotions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_442.wav|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_443.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_444.wav|We know about the crisis in cattle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_445.wav|Everything in golf is a balance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_446.wav|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_447.wav|External auditors will monitor the action which is planned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_448.wav|The people around me were fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_449.wav|That will be best for him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_450.wav|And we might go back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_451.wav|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_452.wav|The villagers were shot in the head at short range.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_453.wav|But you can go beyond that condition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_454.wav|The removal would take place in France.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_455.wav|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_456.wav|But we have built a platform for next season.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_457.wav|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_458.wav|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_459.wav|The jury is still out.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_460.wav|It was like someone had died.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_461.wav|The budget was too low for that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_462.wav|Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_463.wav|Striking the deal has come as a big relief.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_464.wav|The damage is all inside.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_465.wav|Let that be their memorial.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_466.wav|The boys are mentally focused.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_467.wav|This is the stuff of live music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_468.wav|It may prove to be his last involvement with the club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_469.wav|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_471.wav|I see no reason to have this debate at this time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_472.wav|He certainly did a good job!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_473.wav|Talks between directors have been underway since last month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_474.wav|I am certainly thinking about retirement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_475.wav|At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_476.wav|I have always believed in myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_477.wav|The chief constable has retired.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_478.wav|Well, he is an artist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_479.wav|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_480.wav|The casting of her husband was an accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_481.wav|Their coach is obviously under a lot of pressure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_482.wav|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_483.wav|That argument has been won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_484.wav|It was a narrow escape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_485.wav|And rugby fans can help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_486.wav|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_487.wav|The processing plant was closed yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_488.wav|The Israeli military denied the claim.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_489.wav|He is not a dancer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_490.wav|I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_491.wav|IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_492.wav|These people attack the core of my beliefs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_493.wav|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_494.wav|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_495.wav|We would welcome a commercial partner or partners.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p250/p250_496.wav|Subsidy income will not be affected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_025.wav|Johnson was pretty low.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_026.wav|But it failed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_027.wav|That's no bad thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_028.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_029.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_030.wav|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_032.wav|It's a matter of balance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_033.wav|Peace was won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_034.wav|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_035.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_036.wav|Was it worth it?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_037.wav|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_038.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_039.wav|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_040.wav|It was clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_041.wav|They may be wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_042.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_043.wav|Dancing was her life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_044.wav|We will push.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_045.wav|I feel pretty good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_046.wav|That should do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_047.wav|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_048.wav|As she explains.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_049.wav|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_050.wav|It is the whole package.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_051.wav|He had no enemies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_052.wav|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_053.wav|We were surprised to see the photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_054.wav|I had relied on him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_055.wav|This is a step backwards.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_056.wav|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_057.wav|What was the main difference?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_058.wav|Four other charges were dropped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_059.wav|It's a real challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_060.wav|It is not great art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_061.wav|They're appalled by that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_062.wav|It's that kind of place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_063.wav|It was all in a short period of time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_064.wav|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_065.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_066.wav|He was popular.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_067.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_068.wav|That was the easy election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_069.wav|There could be a way back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_070.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_071.wav|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_072.wav|It was chaotic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_073.wav|It is a time bomb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_074.wav|I've not thought about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_075.wav|Today she has been released.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_076.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_077.wav|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_078.wav|I was too young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_079.wav|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_080.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_081.wav|War is not the action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_082.wav|You will be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_083.wav|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_084.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_085.wav|We have turned the corner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_087.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_088.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_089.wav|We must look forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_090.wav|It is an old family habit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_091.wav|Until you hit the big games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_092.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_093.wav|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_094.wav|If you could find it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_095.wav|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_096.wav|Journalists should make him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_097.wav|They were outside the circle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_098.wav|Two of the team became ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_099.wav|That would be unlawful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_100.wav|No date has been set for the appeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_101.wav|It is a good lifestyle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_102.wav|That is no use.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_103.wav|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_104.wav|Further protests are likely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_105.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_106.wav|He was jailed for a year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_107.wav|It had been played at festivals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_108.wav|I came to complete.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_109.wav|You had better believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_110.wav|I was angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_111.wav|The fire was above the hole.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_112.wav|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_113.wav|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_114.wav|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_115.wav|Maybe this battle has been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_116.wav|I joined a group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_117.wav|Does this mean.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_118.wav|It is rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_119.wav|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_120.wav|We work on the same level.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_121.wav|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_122.wav|She has been shot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_123.wav|I'm so angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_124.wav|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_125.wav|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_126.wav|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_127.wav|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_128.wav|Well, you can have a tree.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_129.wav|It was the same at Twickenham.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_130.wav|We had a reunion last week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_131.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_132.wav|Government will intervene.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_133.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_134.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_135.wav|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_136.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_137.wav|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_138.wav|Is that it?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_139.wav|I had decided to quit the show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_140.wav|I am totally devoted to this job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_141.wav|Three penalties were given.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_142.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_143.wav|We just had a go.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_144.wav|We have seen a copy of the report.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_145.wav|The songs are just so good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_146.wav|It is like a football team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_147.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_148.wav|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_149.wav|You know the type.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_150.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_151.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_152.wav|He seemed to lose his focus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_153.wav|It is not normal practice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_154.wav|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_155.wav|I knew he was good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_156.wav|I saw one body.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_157.wav|There's a pause.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_158.wav|Neither side can win this war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_159.wav|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_160.wav|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_161.wav|Eight months later, he was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_162.wav|We have to move forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_163.wav|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_164.wav|Tell it like it was?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_165.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_166.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_167.wav|You are not going in blind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_168.wav|The post will be unpaid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_169.wav|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_170.wav|They thought they had found a home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_171.wav|I always felt they played for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_172.wav|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_173.wav|One season, they might do well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_174.wav|The jury is still out.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_175.wav|We wanted it left for a wee while.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_176.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_177.wav|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_178.wav|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_179.wav|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_180.wav|We knew nothing about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_181.wav|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_182.wav|Four policemen were wounded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_183.wav|We did everything by the book.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_184.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_185.wav|We want to help them through it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_186.wav|I cannot say too much about them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_187.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_188.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_189.wav|People will ask about us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_190.wav|However, this idea is never developed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_191.wav|Last night was a key episode.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_192.wav|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_193.wav|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_194.wav|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_195.wav|It is a case of taking a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_196.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_197.wav|It wasn't to be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_198.wav|It was typical.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_199.wav|It's the same old story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_200.wav|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_201.wav|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_202.wav|There was no option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_203.wav|The conference is the first test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_204.wav|I saw some terrible things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_205.wav|They've got three-quarters of the way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_206.wav|A deadline is still essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_207.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_208.wav|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_209.wav|Today was first class.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_210.wav|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_211.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_212.wav|We have an election in eight days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_213.wav|Now, it's all right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_214.wav|There was an e-mail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_215.wav|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_216.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_217.wav|I began to pray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_218.wav|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_219.wav|We have got to get it right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_220.wav|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_221.wav|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_222.wav|Work has started.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_223.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_224.wav|It's just a place to open it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_225.wav|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_226.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_227.wav|IT S the real thing, for sure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_228.wav|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_230.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_231.wav|We played them off the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_232.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_233.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_234.wav|I am immensely sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_235.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_236.wav|It is a gamble.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_237.wav|But he failed to win the committee's support.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_238.wav|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_239.wav|We were awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_240.wav|However, no further action was taken by police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_241.wav|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_242.wav|They had no children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_243.wav|It is set in Paris.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_244.wav|They should come forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_245.wav|It's quite a line-up!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_246.wav|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_247.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_248.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_249.wav|Of further privacy, he had no need.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_250.wav|My future is in the marathon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_251.wav|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_252.wav|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_253.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_254.wav|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_255.wav|It is hard won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_256.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_257.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_258.wav|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_259.wav|They tried to give her advice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_260.wav|His body was never found.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_262.wav|He's a lovely young man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_263.wav|It was a hit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_264.wav|We are ready.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_265.wav|They know no other way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_266.wav|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_267.wav|We run within the law.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_268.wav|They are interior designers and architects.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_269.wav|Kirkwood was arrested.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_270.wav|they fail to engage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_271.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_272.wav|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_273.wav|I was happily surprised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_274.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_275.wav|I am very angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_276.wav|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_278.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_279.wav|Rehearsals will start in the new year for the extended season.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_280.wav|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_281.wav|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_282.wav|That's the only thing I will say.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_283.wav|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_284.wav|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_285.wav|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_286.wav|He has not created a Festival resource.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_287.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_288.wav|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_289.wav|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_290.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_291.wav|We're in shock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_292.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_293.wav|One knows the feeling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_294.wav|Things can change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_295.wav|It's a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_296.wav|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_297.wav|I am an estate agent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_298.wav|People have no choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_299.wav|She looked so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_300.wav|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_301.wav|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_302.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_303.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_304.wav|You've got to have both sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_305.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_306.wav|Who will perform?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_307.wav|This is a national crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_308.wav|Scotland were beaten again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_309.wav|Who did the recruiting?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_310.wav|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_311.wav|For the moment, our position remains the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_312.wav|The results are sometimes contentious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_313.wav|These figures are truly awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_314.wav|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_315.wav|A new school will be built.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_316.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_317.wav|We have to sort it out ourselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_318.wav|He said she was mad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_319.wav|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_320.wav|Our task is to complete the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_321.wav|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_322.wav|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_323.wav|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_324.wav|You are the glory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_325.wav|The letters are going out today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_326.wav|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_327.wav|We are a peaceful people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_328.wav|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_329.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_330.wav|It is out there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_331.wav|They had a confession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_332.wav|However, the groups denied the claims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_333.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_334.wav|That's the law of the land.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_335.wav|There was no time scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_336.wav|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_337.wav|It's not long enough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_338.wav|I am so upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_339.wav|He was not a big name.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_340.wav|The police have to act to help them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_341.wav|It could have gone either way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_342.wav|Is that an issue?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_343.wav|He can do no wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_344.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_345.wav|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_346.wav|In Scotland, we keep the faith.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_347.wav|The team for the first game could be this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_348.wav|The same things will happen with GM foods.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_349.wav|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_350.wav|He did a good job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_351.wav|We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_352.wav|Well, it won't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_353.wav|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_355.wav|I'm very lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_356.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_357.wav|The composer will conduct.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_359.wav|It is not like working for a living.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_360.wav|They got upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_361.wav|I saw some good things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_362.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_364.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_365.wav|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_366.wav|However, it was well worth the wait.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_367.wav|He has seen the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_368.wav|We will be homeless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_369.wav|That would help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_372.wav|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_373.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p251/p251_374.wav|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored bands increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-position of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_025.wav|Then nine minutes before half time Kenny Miller struck.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_026.wav|This would include insurance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_027.wav|It would fit very well with us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_028.wav|He does not even trust his own members.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_029.wav|Do not give your details to anyone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_030.wav|Schools do not create that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_032.wav|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_033.wav|Just look at his fashion sense.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_034.wav|I have every confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_035.wav|He added that her comments were noted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_036.wav|We've got a real battle now with Richard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_037.wav|Instead, we make the ground pay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_038.wav|That time may never be broken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_039.wav|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_040.wav|He too started on the subs seats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_041.wav|I'm so happy that she did.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_042.wav|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_043.wav|This operation will change her life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_044.wav|Something old something new, as it were.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_045.wav|The youngsters have put us in a strong position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_046.wav|They seem too much of a sure thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_047.wav|That's what set him apart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_048.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_050.wav|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_051.wav|She continued to enjoy sport.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_052.wav|Downing Street also rejected the calls for a European army.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_053.wav|By all accounts he was delighted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_054.wav|Schools will not want change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_055.wav|I think I'm a bit too young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_056.wav|He was failed by his health authority.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_057.wav|We wish to win, but not at any price.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_058.wav|I agree with you about this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_059.wav|Or so he thought.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_060.wav|Must be prepared to use it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_061.wav|The fifth was found later.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_062.wav|For a decade she was proved right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_063.wav|It was dangerous but vital employment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_064.wav|Our people are ready.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_065.wav|These figures cover the major British banking groups.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_066.wav|Probably he wasn't thinking at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_067.wav|Some of their players seemed almost dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_068.wav|People come to see the Highlands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_069.wav|It would have to be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_071.wav|This is a great opportunity for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_072.wav|That is not possible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_073.wav|None has ever been found.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_074.wav|Insurance will perhaps reduce.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_075.wav|Their time has gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_076.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_077.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_078.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_079.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_080.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_081.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_082.wav|What kind of a man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_083.wav|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_084.wav|He has a real potential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_085.wav|LET there be light.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_086.wav|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_087.wav|Scotland has great assets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_088.wav|That remains the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_089.wav|It was exactly four months away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_090.wav|There is no issue of national security involved here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_091.wav|Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_092.wav|Put simply, it goes something like this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_093.wav|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_094.wav|The car driver died.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_095.wav|It looks that way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_096.wav|Now comes the hard part.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_097.wav|We are already seeing some positive results.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_098.wav|We're at home, which is important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_099.wav|They prepared some food very quickly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_100.wav|The circumstances have changed since last year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_101.wav|In his new cabinet role as party chairman, it will become his primary task.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_102.wav|They had three children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_103.wav|Some young girls also came by last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_104.wav|The idea is the shop within a shop.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_105.wav|It would be easy to think so.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_106.wav|And so it went on.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_108.wav|Scotland were on Saturday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_109.wav|We want the results as soon as possible before Thursday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_110.wav|He gets his moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_111.wav|The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_112.wav|There was no reason.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_113.wav|It gets too much.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_114.wav|So they should be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_115.wav|No progress has been made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_116.wav|They need the money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_117.wav|That is the only way to rate players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_118.wav|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_119.wav|Its failure is no surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_120.wav|No country has a similar training programme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_121.wav|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_122.wav|Consumers will also benefit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_123.wav|They pointed to the site.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_124.wav|Tony Blair said as little.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_125.wav|He is at peace with himself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_126.wav|Gold admitted as much.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_127.wav|It seemed like four hours.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_128.wav|Evidence must not be held back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_129.wav|We beat the Welsh team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_130.wav|I saw a lot of good things against Livingston.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_131.wav|Britain's role was to stop it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_132.wav|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_133.wav|Eight others have followed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_134.wav|We're currently looking at the level of support.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_135.wav|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_136.wav|Strong growth is expected from the industrial services division.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_137.wav|It's nice to see a very positive style of football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_138.wav|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_139.wav|It should have its own network.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_140.wav|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_141.wav|But this wasn't the full picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_142.wav|That shows the impact it had.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_143.wav|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_144.wav|I'd always wanted to act.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_145.wav|We hope he will do until he finally does the double.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_146.wav|That is a big risk at any price.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_147.wav|I am never fully fit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_148.wav|Are you going to win ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_149.wav|Was it the wife ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_150.wav|Why change it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_151.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_152.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_153.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_154.wav|What are you not good at ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_155.wav|I think, therefore I am ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_156.wav|Who was she ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_157.wav|He said some things which were better left alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_158.wav|He nearly killed my son.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_160.wav|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_161.wav|I told them during their morning break.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_162.wav|Parents of pupils at the school have also expressed concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_163.wav|Mr Dewar understood that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_164.wav|Nato has left them with no other option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_165.wav|They have shown great character.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_166.wav|I am secure in my own position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_167.wav|It wasn't a pretty match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_168.wav|Health experts said they were not surprised by the findings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_169.wav|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_170.wav|The second failed completely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_171.wav|That apart, though, I feel good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_172.wav|We have come a long way since then.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_173.wav|Sport is good for you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_174.wav|It was clearly not a battle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_175.wav|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_176.wav|You are looking at specialist staff and specialist staff cost money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_177.wav|I'd rather be in our position than Rangers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_178.wav|All options are available.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_179.wav|I knew Donald Dewar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_181.wav|Parents do not know very much about drugs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_182.wav|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_183.wav|I've no idea how it works.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_184.wav|It is actually building on the existing business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_185.wav|Maybe this battle had been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_186.wav|Art can challenge our value system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_187.wav|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_188.wav|London remained the favourite.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_189.wav|I've never had a year like this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_190.wav|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_191.wav|She really suffered for her art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_193.wav|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_194.wav|A child is not a product.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_195.wav|Which can happen any time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_196.wav|Scottish Life was there over one year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_197.wav|Now he is back on top again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_198.wav|The hotel was huge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_199.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_200.wav|was everything done to save people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_201.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_202.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_203.wav|Is it in the right place ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_204.wav|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_205.wav|This should begin in October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_206.wav|There remains some Scottish influence, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_207.wav|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_208.wav|The role was perfect for Russell.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_209.wav|The price was raised after massive demands from retail investors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_210.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_211.wav|Their bodies were never found.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_212.wav|It plans to return to this field.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_213.wav|Business will continue as usual.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_214.wav|I want a free vote.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_215.wav|Fine, said the press officer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_216.wav|The questions came quick and fast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_217.wav|The Boys can speak about little else.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_218.wav|Her experience is certainly limited.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_219.wav|We tried four banks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_220.wav|There is no doubt there's room for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_221.wav|The labour side had developed in the North area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_222.wav|Good records have also been recognised by successful farmers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_223.wav|Brian was last to join.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_224.wav|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_225.wav|Now the door has opened.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_226.wav|I'd rather play well next week than here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_227.wav|Her death is a huge blow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_228.wav|The global market was about flat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_229.wav|Three hit the target.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_230.wav|The idea is simple.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_231.wav|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_232.wav|It's used by Ayr Technical College.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_233.wav|The Queen was on the ball yesterday but off the Euro.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_234.wav|We know the problems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_235.wav|Britain will be little affected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_236.wav|There is a good reason for this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_237.wav|You know the type.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_238.wav|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_239.wav|The board do not own the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_240.wav|That time is not far away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_241.wav|That's been the difference between the sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_242.wav|When I was training.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_243.wav|I did let myself down a bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_244.wav|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_245.wav|This is absolutely not true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_246.wav|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_247.wav|It was a great evening.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_248.wav|We have several options.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_250.wav|Our focus remains on quality revenue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_251.wav|Perhaps it will happen again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_252.wav|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_253.wav|It is based on population rather than need.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_254.wav|We were leading by two goals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_255.wav|It had happened on average once a week this year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_256.wav|It is very much in the eye of the individual.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_258.wav|It was an accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_260.wav|My goals have never changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_262.wav|So we kept them waiting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_263.wav|He makes time for everyone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_264.wav|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_265.wav|The proposal was rejected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_266.wav|Look at a computer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_267.wav|He did better then.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_268.wav|But the next day she paid for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_269.wav|We still think this trade is on the increase.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_270.wav|It is also hoped big name stars could be brought on board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_271.wav|This was the perfect setting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_273.wav|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_274.wav|The long-term trend is equally clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_275.wav|I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_276.wav|All films open tomorrow
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_277.wav|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_278.wav|Paul never gave up hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_279.wav|Those three goals in five minutes changed the game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_280.wav|They bought the property four years ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_281.wav|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_282.wav|Their only score of the half came from a penalty by Jones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_283.wav|It is a dangerous sport.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_284.wav|Oil stocks also provided a boost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_286.wav|The future might well be green after all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_287.wav|They were seriously after him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_288.wav|It was a bit like having children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_289.wav|Aberdeen had little to offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_290.wav|Donald felt it would be an appropriate thing to do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_291.wav|I'm interested in interesting work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_292.wav|His season started this afternoon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_293.wav|He is a good signing for Rangers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_294.wav|White would like to buy further bus businesses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_295.wav|Kenny and I are ready.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_296.wav|Friday night was a pretty good night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_297.wav|He also worked on general building contracts in the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_298.wav|They have played their part.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_299.wav|He followed the Italian route.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_300.wav|Stephen had never considered the question of compensation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_301.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_302.wav|So does every industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_303.wav|Tomorrow will be my last.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_304.wav|But there's also a love for the songs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_305.wav|His career may also provide food for thought for Ferguson.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_306.wav|We must move on.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_307.wav|It's just an area of water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_308.wav|We have achieved that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_309.wav|Their eyes, however, told a different story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_310.wav|Good players have become bad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_311.wav|Many events are down on numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_312.wav|He had served his time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_313.wav|It was a total surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_314.wav|If a service doesn't pay it will go.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_315.wav|The process will start tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_316.wav|Motherwell took them from half chances.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_317.wav|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_319.wav|One finding emerged clearly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_320.wav|There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_321.wav|We lost to a poor team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_322.wav|We are keen to see truth and justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_323.wav|We have clearly become well established.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_324.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_325.wav|Murray plays down return
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_326.wav|Other teams moved up too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_327.wav|Not one person spoke badly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_328.wav|We were caught out.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_329.wav|The performance continues to improve.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_330.wav|We want immediate action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_331.wav|Our relationship has been very good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_332.wav|Someone should tell them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_333.wav|But it won't help British farmers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_334.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_335.wav|Did it work ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_336.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_337.wav|Is our children learning ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_338.wav|How independent is that ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_339.wav|Because I think it's there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_340.wav|If we get the wrong candidate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_341.wav|They emerged before the patients left hospital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_342.wav|They will now remain split up.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_343.wav|We are a husband and wife team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_344.wav|It was the September weekend after all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_345.wav|He would add value.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_346.wav|Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_347.wav|Those overseas offices were great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_348.wav|That was our last chance to do something.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_349.wav|Maybe she is right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_350.wav|I saw one man vote five times.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_351.wav|No plans for projects are yet in place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_352.wav|No sport needs that sort of thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_353.wav|The senior management team will be drawn from both companies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_354.wav|Any increase always has some effect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_355.wav|What form did that take ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_356.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_357.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_358.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_359.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_360.wav|They had better be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_361.wav|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_362.wav|He was a great human being.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_363.wav|That seems highly unlikely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_364.wav|Still, I am delighted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_365.wav|Analysts welcomed the news.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_366.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_367.wav|You will lose benefit because you have broken the rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_368.wav|They made such decisions in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_369.wav|Results of the survey are expected by the end of June.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_370.wav|The whole system is too complex.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_371.wav|He said legal action could be considered.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_372.wav|The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_373.wav|This is far too high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_374.wav|These matters can't just be medical decisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_375.wav|If you believe in the blue and white.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_376.wav|We have no information on Iraq.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_378.wav|The referee faces a massive job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_379.wav|That could be ready within another nine months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_380.wav|Next league matches Kilmarnock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_381.wav|An appeal was unlikely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_382.wav|He said he had now written to Scottish Industry Minister Lord Macdonald.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_383.wav|I got dropped for that game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_384.wav|No real attempt was made to get orders.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_385.wav|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_386.wav|This year I understood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_387.wav|It's clearly a budget.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_388.wav|It's an option, but I can't really comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_389.wav|The women are victims here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_390.wav|I'm not sure that's right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_391.wav|I've kept him in touch with everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_392.wav|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_393.wav|There's nothing natural left.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_394.wav|He could still be President.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_395.wav|There's always a case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_396.wav|The new manager must make tough decisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_397.wav|He has worked hard over the years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_399.wav|It was too difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_400.wav|We will miss him against Celtic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_401.wav|I managed to do that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_402.wav|So what happens next ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_403.wav|Had this been common practice ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_404.wav|What do they want us to do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_405.wav|Is it worth it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_406.wav|Does it matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_407.wav|The doctors are quite positive about my progress.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_408.wav|They had to have hospital treatment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_409.wav|Five local people were injured.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_410.wav|All the dead were believed to have been French.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p252/p252_411.wav|I'd like to report a murder.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_025.wav|But it failed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_026.wav|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_027.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_028.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_029.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_030.wav|This is the window.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_031.wav|He was jailed for five years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_032.wav|Help is needed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_033.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_034.wav|It is marvellous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_035.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_036.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_037.wav|They're just different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_038.wav|It was clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_039.wav|Indeed, he does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_040.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_041.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_042.wav|Dancing was her life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_043.wav|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_044.wav|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_045.wav|They want to be entertained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_046.wav|It's the only thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_047.wav|You had better believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_048.wav|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_049.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_050.wav|A neighbour said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_051.wav|It is bizarre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_052.wav|There is no reason at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_053.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_054.wav|Every aspect of our play was first class.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_055.wav|Our people are ready.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_056.wav|Here's a clue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_057.wav|I was lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_058.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_059.wav|My fitness was very poor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_060.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_061.wav|It is unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_062.wav|I expect a rapid response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_063.wav|It happened so quickly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_064.wav|That's the truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_065.wav|It seems to have worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_066.wav|This is the first step.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_067.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_068.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_069.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_071.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_072.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_073.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_074.wav|It could take some time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_075.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_076.wav|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_077.wav|It is a job creation scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_078.wav|The party is up for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_079.wav|People must remain vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_080.wav|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_081.wav|What has changed?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_082.wav|I will miss him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_083.wav|He is in the queue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_084.wav|I first met him last summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_085.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_086.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_087.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_088.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_089.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_090.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_091.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_092.wav|We are on the path of change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_093.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_095.wav|Yet, it worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_096.wav|He's been hit by it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_097.wav|I love the Dome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_098.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_099.wav|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_100.wav|It is a love affair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_101.wav|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_102.wav|They make a selective perception process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_103.wav|Two of the team became ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_104.wav|That would be unlawful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_106.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_107.wav|It was an adventure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_108.wav|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_109.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_110.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_111.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_112.wav|Is that right?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_113.wav|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_114.wav|It's a shame.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_115.wav|It was the eighties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_116.wav|It is so sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_117.wav|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_118.wav|The mood is upbeat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_119.wav|It is rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_120.wav|Who would be a referee?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_121.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_122.wav|We enjoyed it today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_123.wav|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_124.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_125.wav|There were no grounds for his action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_126.wav|I'm so angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_127.wav|She really suffered for her art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_128.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_129.wav|It's not a U-turn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_130.wav|No production was achieved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_131.wav|I am now unemployed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_132.wav|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_133.wav|It plans to return to this field.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_134.wav|We work well together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_135.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_136.wav|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_138.wav|I was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_139.wav|I don't know the full story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_140.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_141.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_142.wav|He realises his mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_143.wav|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_144.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_145.wav|I was awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_146.wav|Who would have?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_147.wav|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_148.wav|It is not just about pay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_149.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_150.wav|There was a substantial explosion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_151.wav|I was stunned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_152.wav|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_153.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_154.wav|They have not been named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_156.wav|My Dad is a hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_157.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_158.wav|Words were not required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_160.wav|Life becomes a song.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_161.wav|Well, he should know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_162.wav|Was this element always there?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_163.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_164.wav|I'd love to be like Peter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_165.wav|I've put my own money into this project.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_167.wav|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_168.wav|I was in the train station overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_169.wav|We have a budget in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_170.wav|We should do everything at a stroke.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_171.wav|You had to go and see him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_173.wav|In a way he was.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_175.wav|Blair's response was weak.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_176.wav|As we worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_177.wav|We are the gateway to justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_178.wav|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_179.wav|The goals were good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_180.wav|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_181.wav|It's an idea.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_182.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_183.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_184.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_185.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_186.wav|Does this matter?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_187.wav|Our team is just so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_188.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_189.wav|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_190.wav|It caused a lot of upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_191.wav|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_192.wav|We speak about the performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_194.wav|Peace was won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_195.wav|It's a fact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_196.wav|I came home by ambulance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_197.wav|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_198.wav|Is that success?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_199.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_200.wav|Who will pay for this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_201.wav|It's all about money, money, money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_202.wav|Sadly, it can't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_203.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_205.wav|We have an election in eight days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_206.wav|Feel the heat?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_207.wav|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_208.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_209.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_211.wav|Work has started.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_212.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_213.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_214.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_215.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_216.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_217.wav|Then another one came.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_218.wav|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_219.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_220.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_221.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_222.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_223.wav|It's not before time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_224.wav|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_225.wav|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_226.wav|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_227.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_228.wav|My wife and family are the support system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_229.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_230.wav|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_231.wav|We are so proud.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_232.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_233.wav|Of course I was tempted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_234.wav|It's quite a line-up!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_235.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_236.wav|The minister is the engineer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_237.wav|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_238.wav|It is hard won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_239.wav|Our policy is clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_240.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_241.wav|The scene is about this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_242.wav|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_243.wav|My son was too young to die.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_244.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_245.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_247.wav|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_248.wav|That could be in place by next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_249.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_250.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_251.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_252.wav|they fail to engage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_253.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_254.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_255.wav|They must play for each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_256.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_257.wav|There's not much money in cycling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_258.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_260.wav|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_261.wav|He has not created a Festival resource.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_262.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_263.wav|He was also married with two children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_264.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_265.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_266.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_267.wav|One knows the feeling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_268.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_269.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_270.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_271.wav|She failed in her action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_272.wav|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_273.wav|She looked so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_274.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_275.wav|It's so awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_276.wav|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_277.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_278.wav|You've got to have both sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_279.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_280.wav|Dialogue is the key.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_281.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_282.wav|She is an expert on medical ethics.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_283.wav|Who will perform?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_285.wav|Who did the recruiting?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_287.wav|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_288.wav|I was the sheep.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_289.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_290.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_291.wav|Nothing is safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_292.wav|But it's a subtle process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_293.wav|One was a lawyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_294.wav|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_296.wav|They are wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_297.wav|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_298.wav|There were no passengers on board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_299.wav|It could work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_300.wav|This is a war over our home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_301.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_302.wav|There's no evidence he was ever there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_303.wav|You should be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_304.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_305.wav|The letters are going out today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_307.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_308.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_309.wav|She is very distinctive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_310.wav|We have got to get the points from this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_311.wav|You may have a short memory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_313.wav|We are in the end game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_314.wav|It will work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_316.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_317.wav|Our message was inclusive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_318.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_319.wav|Feel the air, the space.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_320.wav|Is there a new way forward?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_322.wav|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_323.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_324.wav|However, they will only be found in the wild.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_326.wav|Three years ago he would have been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_327.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_328.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_329.wav|Two people were interviewed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_330.wav|I've got no secret.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_331.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_332.wav|This is a friendly match?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_333.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_334.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_335.wav|They should take their mobile phones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_336.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_337.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_338.wav|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_339.wav|She is free.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_340.wav|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_341.wav|Tyson is overwhelmed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_342.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_343.wav|Yet he left a few days later.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_344.wav|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_345.wav|As, indeed, they would be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_346.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_348.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_349.wav|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_350.wav|That would help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_351.wav|My husband was angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_352.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_354.wav|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_355.wav|This is a club on the rise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_356.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_357.wav|Their time has gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_358.wav|He could make it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_359.wav|The death rates are still as high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_360.wav|Now, though, he has an incentive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_361.wav|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_363.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_364.wav|It is a simple equation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_365.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_366.wav|It was a funny game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_367.wav|There wasn't a goal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_368.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_369.wav|Colour was at the core of his life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_371.wav|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_372.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_373.wav|Something is wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_374.wav|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_375.wav|That's the name of the game, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_376.wav|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_377.wav|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_378.wav|Does that put pressure on us?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_379.wav|At the last I found a bunker.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_380.wav|Yet the data is compelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_381.wav|It's a real problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_382.wav|It's just outrageous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_383.wav|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_384.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_385.wav|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_386.wav|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_387.wav|They are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_388.wav|I'm glad I came.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_390.wav|I've had my time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_391.wav|It will take place in July.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_392.wav|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_394.wav|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_397.wav|What would be the point?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_399.wav|It might be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_400.wav|The weekly average was three hours.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_401.wav|Relief was beyond belief.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_402.wav|He got his degree.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_403.wav|went on sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_404.wav|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_405.wav|Until they came to do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_407.wav|That may be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_408.wav|It is legally binding.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_409.wav|We went straight into the bedroom.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p253/p253_410.wav|Is there any prospect of this happening?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_025.wav|Johnson was pretty low.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_026.wav|But it failed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_027.wav|They may be wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_028.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_029.wav|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_030.wav|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_031.wav|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_032.wav|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_033.wav|It's a matter of balance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_034.wav|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_035.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_037.wav|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_038.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_039.wav|They're just different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_040.wav|It was clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_041.wav|It is not for any other purpose.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_042.wav|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_043.wav|I was scared.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_044.wav|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_045.wav|No meaningful response was issued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_046.wav|That period was a struggle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_047.wav|I am just going to go for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_048.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_049.wav|This represents a tough game for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_050.wav|It's a crucial award.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_051.wav|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_052.wav|That should do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_053.wav|It's a blessing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_054.wav|Is a drug dealer?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_055.wav|But it might have done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_056.wav|That time has passed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_057.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_058.wav|He is too weak to move.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_059.wav|Life is good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_060.wav|It is the whole package.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_061.wav|This is a club on the rise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_062.wav|He had no enemies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_063.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_064.wav|We were surprised to see the photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_065.wav|That's the day job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_066.wav|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_067.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_068.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_069.wav|My mother is a widow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_070.wav|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_071.wav|Jobs could go.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_072.wav|Four other charges were dropped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_073.wav|They're appalled by that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_074.wav|There was a battle there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_075.wav|It's good news and long overdue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_076.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_077.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_078.wav|They never gave up hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_079.wav|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_080.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_081.wav|It's all I can do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_082.wav|The company yesterday refused to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_083.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_084.wav|The price cuts are really exciting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_085.wav|My office is bare.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_086.wav|Is there a new way forward?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_087.wav|There was an e-mail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_088.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_090.wav|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_091.wav|It may well have been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_092.wav|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_093.wav|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_094.wav|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_095.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_096.wav|All options are open.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_097.wav|You will be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_098.wav|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_099.wav|And rugby fans can help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_100.wav|Now the system is right behind us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_101.wav|However, it did not end that way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_102.wav|This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_103.wav|The group is due to report by the end of the year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_104.wav|I love the Dome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_105.wav|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_106.wav|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_107.wav|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_108.wav|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_109.wav|But it was a pleasure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_110.wav|He takes the job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_111.wav|It was an adventure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_112.wav|That all hope is never lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_113.wav|And I thought - we have to do something with this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_114.wav|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_115.wav|It is normal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_116.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_117.wav|We need to handle it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_118.wav|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_119.wav|It's a long process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_120.wav|They were behind the wheel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_121.wav|The fire was above the hole.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_122.wav|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_123.wav|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_124.wav|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_125.wav|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_126.wav|I joined a group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_127.wav|Does this mean.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_128.wav|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_129.wav|It is a job creation scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_130.wav|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_131.wav|I'm so angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_132.wav|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_133.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_134.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_135.wav|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_136.wav|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_137.wav|It plans to return to this field.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_138.wav|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_139.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_140.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_141.wav|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_143.wav|I was the last man to touch the ball.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_144.wav|Three penalties were given.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_145.wav|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_146.wav|He is severe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_147.wav|It is difficult for Ali.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_148.wav|There is a lack of chemistry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_149.wav|This is the way things should be handled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_150.wav|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_151.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_152.wav|It is not just about pay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_153.wav|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_154.wav|You know the type.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_155.wav|The weaknesses are few.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_156.wav|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_157.wav|I was in daily contact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_158.wav|We will turn the corner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_159.wav|This latter point is hugely important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_160.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_161.wav|It has been a lovely family occasion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_162.wav|He's a nice guy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_163.wav|It has to be now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_164.wav|They are not advertised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_165.wav|I have got a wife to feed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_166.wav|Tell it like it was?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_167.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_168.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_169.wav|We started to struggle with each other towards the end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_170.wav|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_171.wav|He was a crazy man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_172.wav|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_173.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_174.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_175.wav|It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_176.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_177.wav|The clarity is vital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_178.wav|The hotel was now for sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_179.wav|Tony had arrived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_180.wav|He will need that machine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_181.wav|I was totally wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_182.wav|We did everything by the book.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_183.wav|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_184.wav|However, this idea is never developed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_185.wav|I grew up listening to these people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_186.wav|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_187.wav|Peace was won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_188.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_189.wav|I wanted to put myself on the line.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_190.wav|Off I went.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_191.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_192.wav|Is that it?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_193.wav|The conference is the first test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_194.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_195.wav|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_196.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_197.wav|They've got three-quarters of the way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_198.wav|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_199.wav|Today was first class.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_200.wav|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_201.wav|We have an election in eight days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_202.wav|It's like a garage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_203.wav|But I am a worried man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_204.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_205.wav|That is an important part of our role.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_206.wav|It is a small part, and it's very small in the book.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_207.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_208.wav|I began to pray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_209.wav|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_210.wav|His third goal was superb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_211.wav|It's not ideal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_212.wav|The FBI could become involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_213.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_214.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_215.wav|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_216.wav|A career as a doctor is on hold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_217.wav|You have to do your research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_218.wav|Saturday is gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_219.wav|We played them off the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_220.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_221.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_222.wav|The boy is no longer with us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_223.wav|The track is currently covered in snow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_224.wav|They are the innocent victims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_225.wav|It's so special.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_226.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_227.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_228.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_229.wav|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_230.wav|They tried to give her advice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_231.wav|And thought we would get away with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_232.wav|We were a load of rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_233.wav|They should come forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_234.wav|It is not the message alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_235.wav|He will make a statement on the dispute in the Commons tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_236.wav|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_237.wav|It's a lovely, lovely film.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_238.wav|But it's a subtle process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_239.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_240.wav|My future is in the marathon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_241.wav|They are all bright and different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_242.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_243.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_244.wav|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_245.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_246.wav|He got the same story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_247.wav|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_248.wav|I was shocked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_249.wav|He's a lovely young man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_250.wav|There's the mix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_251.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_252.wav|This year I understood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_253.wav|That could be in place by next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_254.wav|I was never going to play against Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_255.wav|It's a source of deep concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_256.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_257.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_258.wav|The pensioners did not want to know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_259.wav|It is also very valuable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_260.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_261.wav|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_262.wav|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_263.wav|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_264.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_265.wav|There is no link.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_266.wav|This is a question of Islam.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_267.wav|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_268.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_269.wav|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_270.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_271.wav|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_272.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_273.wav|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_275.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_276.wav|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_277.wav|It's a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_278.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_279.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_280.wav|People have no choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_281.wav|If not, he should go home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_282.wav|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_283.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_284.wav|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_285.wav|I saw it at a ruck.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_286.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_287.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_288.wav|He will address the nation this evening.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_289.wav|The mood is good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_290.wav|It's like a high school play.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_291.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_292.wav|This is a national crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_293.wav|Well, he can do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_294.wav|These figures are truly awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_295.wav|That could change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_296.wav|Who can predict?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_297.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_298.wav|One was a lawyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_299.wav|It is a road of death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_300.wav|The plot is minimal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_301.wav|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_302.wav|I did not name it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_303.wav|We have waited a long time for this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_304.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_305.wav|They were fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_306.wav|We are a peaceful people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_307.wav|Craig is a major concern for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_308.wav|The problems began a long time ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_309.wav|My body is clearly capable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_310.wav|It is out there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_311.wav|He said she was mad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_312.wav|In the old days, it was easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_313.wav|We are in the end game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_314.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_315.wav|It is a strong case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_316.wav|The parents will have a great time, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_317.wav|Donald was his friend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_318.wav|He was not a big name.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_319.wav|The police have to act to help them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_320.wav|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_321.wav|The boat was fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_322.wav|It's not long enough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_323.wav|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_324.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_326.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_327.wav|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_329.wav|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_330.wav|They haven't got a hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_331.wav|It has moved on in the last week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_332.wav|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_333.wav|Today she has been released.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_334.wav|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_335.wav|It should be a great game, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_336.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_337.wav|It should be scrapped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_338.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_339.wav|It was good for us that they lost that day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_340.wav|They should take their mobile phones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_341.wav|It is not like working for a living.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_342.wav|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_343.wav|It is long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_344.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_345.wav|Tell us about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_346.wav|It's all going to clear the debt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_347.wav|That is a break with tradition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_348.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_349.wav|It was very formal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_350.wav|I kept going for her.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_351.wav|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_352.wav|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_353.wav|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_354.wav|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_355.wav|We will be homeless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_356.wav|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_357.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_358.wav|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_359.wav|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_360.wav|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_361.wav|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_362.wav|The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_363.wav|There was no option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_364.wav|It's now down in black and white.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_365.wav|Now, though, he has an incentive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_366.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_367.wav|They received a reply from their own managers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_368.wav|But I managed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_369.wav|Five members were disciplined.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_370.wav|Talks are progressing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_371.wav|They play together perfectly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_372.wav|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_373.wav|It's a record label, not a form of music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_374.wav|It became a national network.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_375.wav|It is a large number.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_376.wav|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_377.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_378.wav|He has the edge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_379.wav|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_380.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_381.wav|Face to face
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_382.wav|I am very happy with life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_383.wav|I'm just enjoying every match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_384.wav|The service would also make a massive impact on tourism.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_385.wav|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_386.wav|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_387.wav|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_388.wav|They really did a great job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_389.wav|At the last I found a bunker.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_390.wav|Yet the data is compelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_391.wav|Perhaps the time has come to put the cup in a museum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_392.wav|I would have loved to play in an Old Firm.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_393.wav|I'm pleased about one thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_394.wav|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_395.wav|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_396.wav|We're looking for justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_397.wav|I can lead by example.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_398.wav|Eriksson would have approved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_399.wav|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_400.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_401.wav|It really is a gift to the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_402.wav|The car was just there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p254/p254_403.wav|It was on fire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_025.wav|He has not been named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_026.wav|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_027.wav|They should be so lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_028.wav|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_029.wav|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_030.wav|Life was like a timetable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_031.wav|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_032.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_033.wav|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_034.wav|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_035.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_036.wav|We do not expect any surplus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_037.wav|Dancing was her life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_038.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_039.wav|It is a memorial.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_040.wav|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_041.wav|But it might have done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_042.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_043.wav|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_044.wav|I felt really good until Friday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_045.wav|She looked so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_046.wav|Life is good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_047.wav|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_048.wav|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_049.wav|We were surprised to see the photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_050.wav|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_051.wav|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_052.wav|It's very odd.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_053.wav|Because we do not need it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_054.wav|That's the truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_055.wav|My mother is a widow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_057.wav|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_058.wav|There will be tough opponents to this report.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_059.wav|Equity declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_060.wav|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_061.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_062.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_063.wav|We should have known.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_064.wav|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_065.wav|The end result is precisely the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_066.wav|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_067.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_068.wav|There could be a way back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_069.wav|He highlighted a lack of staff.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_070.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_071.wav|Ferguson should take note.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_072.wav|It works for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_073.wav|He is now resident in England.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_074.wav|I've got the shirt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_075.wav|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_076.wav|What has changed?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_077.wav|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_078.wav|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_079.wav|He is driven.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_080.wav|Nothing is yet confirmed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_081.wav|We have other options.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_082.wav|We want to know about the policy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_083.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_084.wav|It's never too late.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_085.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_086.wav|We do not get that impression now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_087.wav|It is a lifeline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_088.wav|However, it did not end that way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_089.wav|They've got to account for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_090.wav|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_091.wav|Until you hit the big games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_092.wav|We could not get any possession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_093.wav|If you could find it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_094.wav|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_095.wav|It is a delight on every level.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_096.wav|Get to know him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_097.wav|May not have been at fault?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_098.wav|I had a ball today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_099.wav|Two of the team became ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_100.wav|That time is not now, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_101.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_102.wav|Scotland were beaten again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_103.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_104.wav|Further protests are likely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_105.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_106.wav|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_107.wav|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_108.wav|He was jailed for a year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_109.wav|I came to complete.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_110.wav|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_111.wav|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_112.wav|Maybe this battle has been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_113.wav|I'm delighted about that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_114.wav|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_115.wav|I joined a group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_116.wav|Does this mean.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_117.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_118.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_119.wav|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_120.wav|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_121.wav|I can't even get into the A team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_122.wav|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_123.wav|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_124.wav|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_125.wav|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_126.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_127.wav|It will be too hot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_128.wav|The role was perfect for Russell.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_129.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_130.wav|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_131.wav|Our intentions are real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_132.wav|It is also well received.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_133.wav|The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_134.wav|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_135.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_136.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_137.wav|I saw some terrible things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_138.wav|It's a question of fashion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_139.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_140.wav|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_141.wav|We have got to get it right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_142.wav|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_143.wav|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_144.wav|Who would be right?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_145.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_146.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_147.wav|I was awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_148.wav|The idea is simple.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_149.wav|It is like a football team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_150.wav|It would be a last resort.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_151.wav|He sets the nature of his Parliament in simple, realistic context.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_152.wav|It is not just about pay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_153.wav|The home side didn't stand a chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_154.wav|We shall not be moved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_155.wav|The weaknesses are few.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_156.wav|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_157.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_158.wav|The first victory made a huge difference to my career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_159.wav|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_160.wav|Work has started.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_161.wav|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_162.wav|And sooner than we may think.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_163.wav|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_164.wav|It is so unfair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_165.wav|I will tell you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_166.wav|Eight months later, he was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_167.wav|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_168.wav|We have to move forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_169.wav|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_170.wav|I lost my head.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_171.wav|That must be left to the Parole Board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_172.wav|He is keen to stay in public service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_173.wav|You are not going in blind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_174.wav|They will do their own thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_175.wav|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_176.wav|You had to go and see him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_177.wav|Waiting times for these services are too long.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_178.wav|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_179.wav|His team management was protective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_180.wav|Is Saddam a threat?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_181.wav|The jury is still out.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_182.wav|We wanted it left for a wee while.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_183.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_184.wav|And I saw the light!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_185.wav|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_186.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_187.wav|Tony had arrived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_188.wav|It is the whole package.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_189.wav|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_190.wav|The goals were good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_191.wav|There is no point in looking any further.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_192.wav|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_193.wav|Four policemen were wounded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_194.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_195.wav|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_196.wav|They are now divorced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_197.wav|I cannot say too much about them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_198.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_199.wav|However, this idea is never developed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_200.wav|It is a farce.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_201.wav|I am totally surprised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_202.wav|We must keep our feet on the ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_203.wav|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_204.wav|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_205.wav|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_206.wav|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_207.wav|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_208.wav|It's just awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_209.wav|It's all about money, money, money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_210.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_211.wav|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_212.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_213.wav|We'll have to work hard today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_214.wav|He knows a lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_215.wav|That is an important part of our role.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_216.wav|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_217.wav|I had relied on him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_218.wav|I had decided to quit the show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_219.wav|His third goal was superb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_220.wav|It's been a good year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_221.wav|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_222.wav|It's not ideal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_223.wav|The FBI could become involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_224.wav|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_225.wav|The attacker has been put in foster care.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_226.wav|His death was a tragic accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_227.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_228.wav|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_229.wav|A career as a doctor is on hold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_230.wav|During the communist time they were very privileged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_231.wav|Mental health is a massive issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_232.wav|We played them off the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_233.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_234.wav|Our numbers are small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_235.wav|They are the innocent victims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_236.wav|It's like a basketball.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_237.wav|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_238.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_239.wav|It's the same as Glasgow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_240.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_241.wav|It is mainstream.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_242.wav|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_243.wav|We were awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_244.wav|They had no children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_245.wav|It is set in Paris.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_246.wav|It is not the message alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_247.wav|It's quite a line-up!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_248.wav|It has been declared.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_249.wav|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_250.wav|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_251.wav|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_252.wav|It's only fair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_253.wav|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_254.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_255.wav|His body was never found.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_256.wav|There's the mix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_257.wav|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_258.wav|I can't get a job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_259.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_260.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_261.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_262.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_263.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_264.wav|I am very angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_265.wav|They must play for each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_266.wav|He can do everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_267.wav|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_268.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_269.wav|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_270.wav|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_271.wav|It's all change on the music scene in Manchester.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_272.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_273.wav|This is a question of Islam.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_274.wav|It looks as though he will be right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_275.wav|He was popular.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_276.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_277.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_278.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_279.wav|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_280.wav|One knows the feeling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_281.wav|He promised to lead from the front in battle for entry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_282.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_283.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_284.wav|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_285.wav|This is a national crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_286.wav|The death toll included five children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_287.wav|My body is clearly capable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_288.wav|So I did.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_289.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_290.wav|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_292.wav|These figures are truly awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_293.wav|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_294.wav|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_295.wav|Who can predict?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_296.wav|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_297.wav|A new school will be built.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_298.wav|I have tonight resigned as member of the European Commission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_299.wav|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_300.wav|Graeme was prepared.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_301.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_302.wav|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_303.wav|Our task is to complete the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_304.wav|they fail to engage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_305.wav|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_306.wav|The company yesterday refused to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_307.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_308.wav|It's certainly different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_309.wav|Is there on his hands?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_310.wav|We have got no money to go anywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_311.wav|It's about my time as a guitarist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_312.wav|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_313.wav|I never thought it would take this long.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_314.wav|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_315.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_316.wav|Henman has been warned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_317.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_318.wav|I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_319.wav|For the moment, our position remains the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_320.wav|Referees are easy targets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_321.wav|There was some merit in that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_322.wav|I came into this world with nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_323.wav|That's the law of the land.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_324.wav|They will be destroyed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_325.wav|It is a strong case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_326.wav|My view has now completely changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_327.wav|The police have to act to help them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_328.wav|We agreed to disagree.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_329.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_330.wav|It could have gone either way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_331.wav|It is a time bomb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_332.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_333.wav|It can be halted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_334.wav|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_335.wav|They haven't got a hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_336.wav|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_337.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_338.wav|The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_339.wav|Today, we begin to answer that question.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_340.wav|Look at the witnesses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_341.wav|Nobody else was with me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_342.wav|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_343.wav|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_344.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_345.wav|This is a friendly match?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_346.wav|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_347.wav|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_348.wav|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_349.wav|That is a break with tradition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_350.wav|I kept going for her.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_351.wav|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_352.wav|He's very explosive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_353.wav|I was in the train station overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_354.wav|It benefits the whole family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_355.wav|It was one in the afternoon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_356.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_357.wav|We will be homeless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_358.wav|It was fit for royalty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_359.wav|We are looking for perfection.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_360.wav|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_361.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_362.wav|I have got a wife to feed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_363.wav|I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_364.wav|Not so, it seems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_365.wav|Tell it like it was?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_366.wav|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_367.wav|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_368.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_369.wav|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_370.wav|They received a reply from their own managers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_371.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_372.wav|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_373.wav|It's a long process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_374.wav|Not because they want to sing about something.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_375.wav|He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_376.wav|Colour was at the core of his life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_377.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_378.wav|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_379.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_380.wav|The casualties were not named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p255/p255_381.wav|I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_025.wav|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_026.wav|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_027.wav|I have a theory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_028.wav|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_029.wav|There's a story, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_030.wav|I was an athlete.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_031.wav|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_032.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_033.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_034.wav|A web site is planned for November.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_035.wav|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_036.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_037.wav|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_038.wav|They're just different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_039.wav|It's a real threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_040.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_041.wav|It had been played at festivals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_042.wav|Indeed, he does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_043.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_044.wav|This film will be totally awesome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_045.wav|No meaningful response was issued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_046.wav|That period was a struggle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_047.wav|A neighbour said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_048.wav|It's a crucial award.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_049.wav|It is difficult for Ali.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_050.wav|It's a blessing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_051.wav|Is a drug dealer?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_052.wav|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_053.wav|I would love to have him home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_054.wav|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_055.wav|He had no enemies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_056.wav|Sadly, it can't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_057.wav|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_058.wav|It is unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_059.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_060.wav|That's the truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_061.wav|That is very hard, alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_062.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_063.wav|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_064.wav|And a film maker was born.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_065.wav|It's a matter of balance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_066.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_067.wav|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_068.wav|They may yet have the last laugh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_069.wav|There was a battle there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_070.wav|They are real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_071.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_072.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_073.wav|It should be devolved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_074.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_075.wav|I was as strong as a horse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_076.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_077.wav|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_078.wav|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_079.wav|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_080.wav|It is a terrible place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_081.wav|I've got the shirt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_082.wav|This is the way things should be handled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_083.wav|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_084.wav|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_085.wav|It may well have been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_086.wav|I first met him last summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_087.wav|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_088.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_089.wav|It's never too late.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_090.wav|It was nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_091.wav|We do not get that impression now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_092.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_093.wav|That will come after the game on Saturday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_094.wav|A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_095.wav|We must look forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_096.wav|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_097.wav|They've got to account for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_098.wav|She told The Herald.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_099.wav|It was clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_100.wav|There was no rescue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_101.wav|We could not get any possession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_102.wav|They are now divorced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_103.wav|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_104.wav|Journalists should make him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_105.wav|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_106.wav|Get to know him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_107.wav|But it was a pleasure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_108.wav|We have every respect for Michelle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_109.wav|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_110.wav|I didn't play well last year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_111.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_112.wav|They will want to perform well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_113.wav|It's not perfect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_114.wav|It was the eighties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_115.wav|They were behind the wheel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_116.wav|This is a step backwards.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_117.wav|It was ugly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_118.wav|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_119.wav|I joined a group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_120.wav|It is rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_121.wav|Who would be a referee?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_122.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_123.wav|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_124.wav|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_125.wav|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_126.wav|There were no grounds for his action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_127.wav|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_128.wav|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_129.wav|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_130.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_131.wav|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_132.wav|Well, you can have a tree.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_133.wav|Who will attend?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_134.wav|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_135.wav|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_136.wav|Our intentions are real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_137.wav|It is also well received.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_138.wav|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_139.wav|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_140.wav|It was very frightened and dirty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_141.wav|We want to keep the pound.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_142.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_143.wav|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_144.wav|It changed my life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_145.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_146.wav|It is not just about pay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_147.wav|The home side didn't stand a chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_148.wav|I was so nervous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_149.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_150.wav|They have not been named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_151.wav|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_152.wav|We should be clear about the role of government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_153.wav|It was by the numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_154.wav|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_155.wav|We will turn the corner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_156.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_157.wav|He can do no wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_158.wav|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_159.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_160.wav|I will tell you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_161.wav|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_162.wav|It has to be now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_163.wav|We have to move forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_164.wav|They are not advertised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_165.wav|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_166.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_167.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_168.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_169.wav|The post will be unpaid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_170.wav|Does that put pressure on us?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_171.wav|Waiting times for these services are too long.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_172.wav|It is too much for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_173.wav|We've made a couple of albums.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_174.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_175.wav|If that's the case, he will struggle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_176.wav|The hotel was now for sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_177.wav|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_178.wav|They took a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_179.wav|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_180.wav|There is no point in looking any further.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_181.wav|Nothing is safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_182.wav|They will run a mile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_183.wav|Four policemen were wounded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_184.wav|They receive a high profile in the media.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_185.wav|We did everything by the book.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_186.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_187.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_188.wav|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_189.wav|It is a terrible loss.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_190.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_191.wav|If the director is with you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_192.wav|I am totally surprised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_193.wav|I grew up listening to these people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_194.wav|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_195.wav|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_196.wav|It is a case of taking a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_197.wav|I wanted to put myself on the line.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_198.wav|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_199.wav|People acted too quickly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_200.wav|I have a cold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_201.wav|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_202.wav|Tommy is not a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_203.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_204.wav|They've got three-quarters of the way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_205.wav|But she might be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_206.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_207.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_208.wav|It's like a garage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_209.wav|But I am a worried man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_210.wav|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_211.wav|She should not be blamed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_212.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_213.wav|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_214.wav|The FBI could become involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_215.wav|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_216.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_217.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_218.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_219.wav|We've got the bronze.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_220.wav|It's so special.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_221.wav|We will be victorious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_222.wav|He seemed to lose his focus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_223.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_224.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_225.wav|I am immensely sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_226.wav|It is a gamble.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_227.wav|My neighbours are horrified.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_228.wav|The track is currently covered in snow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_229.wav|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_230.wav|They are the innocent victims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_231.wav|My wife and family are the support system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_232.wav|The body follows the mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_233.wav|It is set in Paris.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_234.wav|It's quite nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_235.wav|It's a lovely, lovely film.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_236.wav|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_237.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_238.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_239.wav|He was good, but not that good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_240.wav|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_241.wav|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_242.wav|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_243.wav|It is hard won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_244.wav|He says that he is no different from any other man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_245.wav|The scene is about this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_246.wav|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_247.wav|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_248.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_249.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_250.wav|It was a hit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_251.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_252.wav|Her presence was almost everywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_253.wav|I was never going to play against Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_254.wav|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_255.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_256.wav|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_257.wav|Chelsea was a great club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_258.wav|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_259.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_260.wav|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_261.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_262.wav|I am very angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_263.wav|The pensioners did not want to know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_264.wav|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_265.wav|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_266.wav|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_267.wav|That's the only thing I will say.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_268.wav|It looks as though he will be right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_269.wav|Of course, that is not the whole story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_270.wav|He has not created a Festival resource.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_271.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_272.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_273.wav|And Michael was just great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_274.wav|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_275.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_276.wav|I am an estate agent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_277.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_278.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_279.wav|It happens from time to time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_280.wav|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_281.wav|But I've won both ways.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_282.wav|I saw it at a ruck.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_283.wav|The attacker died in the crash.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_284.wav|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_285.wav|It's like a high school play.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_286.wav|Scotland were beaten again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_287.wav|It's very safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_288.wav|He was obviously very genuine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_289.wav|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_290.wav|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_291.wav|He wrote the letter two days before he died.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_292.wav|The results are sometimes contentious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_293.wav|The songs are just so good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_294.wav|Who can predict?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_295.wav|They are a total disgrace to the loyalist cause.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_296.wav|It became a book by itself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_297.wav|The home was now under new management.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_298.wav|I thought it was my only chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_300.wav|One was a lawyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_301.wav|Our task is to complete the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_302.wav|The party lasted all night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_303.wav|It's so awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_304.wav|It's just not funny!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_305.wav|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_306.wav|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_307.wav|It is no surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_308.wav|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_309.wav|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_310.wav|We have waited a long time for this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_311.wav|This is the culture change in medicine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_312.wav|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_313.wav|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_314.wav|It is all credit to them today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_315.wav|They were fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_316.wav|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_317.wav|She is very distinctive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_318.wav|It's not even finished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_319.wav|Henman has been warned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p256/p256_320.wav|It should be equal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_025.wav|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_026.wav|Is this accurate?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_027.wav|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_028.wav|Because we do not need it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_029.wav|Life was like a timetable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_030.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_031.wav|It was clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_032.wav|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_033.wav|I came to complete.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_034.wav|President Bush is at war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_035.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_036.wav|I was scared.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_037.wav|It was ugly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_038.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_039.wav|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_040.wav|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_041.wav|A neighbour said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_042.wav|We need to chat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_043.wav|The boy is no longer with us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_044.wav|I hate the word.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_045.wav|That should do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_046.wav|It's a blessing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_047.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_048.wav|As she explains.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_049.wav|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_050.wav|He had no enemies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_051.wav|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_052.wav|But the law is very clear on this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_053.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_054.wav|We were surprised to see the photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_055.wav|Next league matches Celtic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_056.wav|It's very odd.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_057.wav|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_058.wav|It is not great art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_059.wav|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_060.wav|There was a battle there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_061.wav|Scotland had great assets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_062.wav|There will be tough opponents to this report.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_063.wav|Have a look at our accounts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_064.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_065.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_066.wav|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_067.wav|It's all I can do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_068.wav|There could be a way back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_069.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_070.wav|The price cuts are really exciting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_071.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_072.wav|I had my suspicions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_073.wav|She died in hospital two hours later.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_074.wav|It was chaotic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_075.wav|Is there a new way forward?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_076.wav|I've not thought about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_077.wav|People must remain vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_078.wav|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_079.wav|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_080.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_081.wav|It may well have been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_082.wav|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_083.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_084.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_085.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_086.wav|It's never too late.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_087.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_088.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_089.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_090.wav|Today I couldn't run on it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_091.wav|We must look forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_092.wav|It is an old family habit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_093.wav|He was possessed
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_094.wav|She told The Herald.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_095.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_096.wav|The peace process will be buried!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_097.wav|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_098.wav|They are now divorced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_099.wav|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_100.wav|It was mayhem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_101.wav|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_102.wav|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_103.wav|We have every respect for Michelle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_104.wav|That time is not now, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_105.wav|I didn't play well last year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_106.wav|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_107.wav|They will want to perform well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_108.wav|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_109.wav|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_110.wav|It is normal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_111.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_112.wav|I don't have many friends.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_113.wav|It's a shame.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_114.wav|It was the eighties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_115.wav|We do not expect any surplus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_116.wav|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_117.wav|It's not a new concept in jazz.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_118.wav|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_119.wav|I'm delighted about that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_120.wav|Does this mean.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_121.wav|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_122.wav|He did his job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_123.wav|You can spend money on housing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_124.wav|That's all right then.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_125.wav|I was furious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_126.wav|It has removed a bit of guilt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_127.wav|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_128.wav|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_129.wav|So the European elections are extremely important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_130.wav|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_131.wav|Who will attend?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_132.wav|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_133.wav|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_134.wav|I am now unemployed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_135.wav|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_136.wav|They made such decisions in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_137.wav|Our intentions are real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_138.wav|It is also well received.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_139.wav|What will happen then?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_140.wav|It's not true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_141.wav|I feel very grateful with everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_142.wav|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_143.wav|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_144.wav|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_145.wav|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_146.wav|There is a lack of chemistry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_147.wav|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_148.wav|It is like a football team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_149.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_150.wav|He will emerge as a world leader.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_151.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_152.wav|They did very well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_153.wav|It became a book by itself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_154.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_155.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_156.wav|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_157.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_158.wav|There's a pause.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_159.wav|He can do no wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_160.wav|It was so new, so exciting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_161.wav|I've learned from my mistakes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_162.wav|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_163.wav|I've put my own money into this project.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_164.wav|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_165.wav|I lost my head.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_166.wav|You are not going in blind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_167.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_168.wav|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_169.wav|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_170.wav|My life has been destroyed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_171.wav|There was no hint of scandal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_172.wav|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_173.wav|I feel like my game has come a long way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_174.wav|We wanted it left for a wee while.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_175.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_176.wav|It's quite a routine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_177.wav|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_178.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_179.wav|Everyone can be bought.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_180.wav|It is minute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_181.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_182.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_183.wav|One was a lawyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_184.wav|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_185.wav|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_186.wav|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_187.wav|Saturday is gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_188.wav|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_189.wav|Last night was a key episode.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_190.wav|We must keep our feet on the ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_191.wav|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_192.wav|Off I went.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_193.wav|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_194.wav|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_195.wav|Ferguson should take note.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_196.wav|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_197.wav|It's just awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_198.wav|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_199.wav|IT S all in the hair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_200.wav|We have an election in eight days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_201.wav|But I am a worried man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_202.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_203.wav|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_204.wav|He knows a lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_205.wav|He is slightly confused.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_206.wav|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_207.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_208.wav|I am delighted for Simon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_209.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_210.wav|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_211.wav|We have got to get it right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_212.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_213.wav|I might come back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_214.wav|His death was a tragic accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_215.wav|It's just a place to open it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_216.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_217.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_218.wav|William Hague delighted his party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_219.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_220.wav|We played them off the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_221.wav|She really suffered for her art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_222.wav|He demanded to speak to the boss.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_223.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_224.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_225.wav|I think he's the favourite, no question.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_226.wav|Broke the birdie record.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_227.wav|They had no children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_228.wav|It is set in Paris.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_229.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_230.wav|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_231.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_232.wav|John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, will fly to the summit tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_233.wav|But it's a subtle process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_234.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_235.wav|My future is in the marathon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_236.wav|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_237.wav|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_238.wav|They may yet have the last laugh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_239.wav|You can feel at home in China.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_240.wav|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_241.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_242.wav|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_243.wav|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_244.wav|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_245.wav|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_246.wav|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_247.wav|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_248.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_249.wav|I watched a game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_250.wav|They are interior designers and architects.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_251.wav|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_252.wav|they fail to engage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_253.wav|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_254.wav|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_255.wav|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_256.wav|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_257.wav|Blood samples were taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_258.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_259.wav|It's very nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_260.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_261.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_262.wav|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_263.wav|And Michael was just great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_264.wav|We're in shock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_265.wav|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_266.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_267.wav|One knows the feeling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_268.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_269.wav|She looked so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_270.wav|It was a privilege to work for him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_271.wav|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_272.wav|He looked very sharp.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_273.wav|You've got to have both sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_274.wav|Who did the recruiting?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_275.wav|Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_276.wav|Well, he can do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_277.wav|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_278.wav|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_279.wav|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_280.wav|The results are sometimes contentious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_281.wav|He should have won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_282.wav|A new school will be built.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_283.wav|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_284.wav|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_285.wav|What has altered?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_286.wav|The home was now under new management.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_287.wav|Graeme was prepared.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_288.wav|I thought it was my only chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_289.wav|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_290.wav|It just came into my head that day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_291.wav|They are wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_292.wav|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_293.wav|It's just not funny!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_294.wav|I am very happy to be here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_295.wav|The plot is minimal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_296.wav|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_297.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_298.wav|This is the culture change in medicine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_299.wav|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_300.wav|They were fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_301.wav|I never thought it would take this long.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_302.wav|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_303.wav|They wanted the club to make money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_304.wav|Kids are terrible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_305.wav|Henman has been warned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_306.wav|It should be equal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_307.wav|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_308.wav|The home team had an amazing start.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_309.wav|It is out there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_310.wav|They had a confession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_311.wav|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_312.wav|We are in the end game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_313.wav|I came into this world with nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_314.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_315.wav|I am so upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_316.wav|The boat was fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_317.wav|I saw some good things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_318.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_319.wav|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_320.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_321.wav|Three years ago he would have been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_322.wav|You feel the pride.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_323.wav|It is so unfair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_324.wav|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_325.wav|Indeed, it was magical.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_326.wav|I've got no secret.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_327.wav|Look at the witnesses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_328.wav|I'm very lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_329.wav|We must do something.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_330.wav|He says that he is no different from any other man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_331.wav|Alex Ferguson is the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_332.wav|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_333.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_334.wav|It is not like working for a living.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_335.wav|It is long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_336.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_337.wav|Tell us about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_338.wav|The salary changes are long overdue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_339.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_340.wav|It was very formal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_341.wav|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_342.wav|Tyson is overwhelmed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_343.wav|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_344.wav|I wanted to go out on a high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_345.wav|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_346.wav|I felt really good until Friday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_347.wav|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_348.wav|He could face a jail sentence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_349.wav|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_350.wav|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_351.wav|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_352.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_353.wav|There is no signature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_354.wav|It's a long process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_355.wav|It is a large number.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_356.wav|He knew his job inside out.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_357.wav|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_358.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_359.wav|It does not even have a staff shortage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_360.wav|I haven't had a kick at a Celtic player for a while.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_361.wav|He has the edge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_362.wav|He denied the charge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_363.wav|There were no casualties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_364.wav|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_365.wav|YOU thought it was a headache.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_366.wav|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_367.wav|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_368.wav|They really did a great job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_369.wav|There is a solution, she believes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_370.wav|However, it's good to turn the page.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_371.wav|This year I understood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_372.wav|I'm pleased about one thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_373.wav|It is unusual.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_374.wav|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_375.wav|It is likely the rest of the market will follow suit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_376.wav|I can lead by example.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_377.wav|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_378.wav|They are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_379.wav|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_380.wav|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_381.wav|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_382.wav|It was on fire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_383.wav|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_384.wav|I never won a penny throughout my career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_385.wav|Emotions were complex.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_386.wav|He's already made history.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_387.wav|So I did.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_388.wav|You ask the question.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_389.wav|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_390.wav|There was no trouble.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_391.wav|This is a huge confidence boost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_392.wav|Not because they want to sing about something.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_393.wav|It is not a standing army.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_394.wav|We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_395.wav|I believe the gap is nearly there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_396.wav|You wanted the evidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_397.wav|Our numbers are small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_398.wav|I was very young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_399.wav|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_400.wav|I am the Son of Sam.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_401.wav|She is superb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_402.wav|Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_403.wav|It doesn't always work that way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_404.wav|It is simple, but profound.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_405.wav|No preference emerged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_406.wav|But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_407.wav|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_408.wav|She has reached the top of her profession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_409.wav|It goes with the job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_410.wav|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_411.wav|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_412.wav|I recommend a tour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_413.wav|We are delighted with this outcome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_414.wav|I have so much respect for him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_415.wav|We shall be victorious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_416.wav|Rather than answer, she resigned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_417.wav|War is not the action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_418.wav|They said so that I would look good in uniform.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_419.wav|It's not about defining styles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_420.wav|One must hope not!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_421.wav|It is marvellous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_422.wav|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_423.wav|They should not be blamed for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_424.wav|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_425.wav|It is bizarre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_426.wav|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_427.wav|I was just overwhelmed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_428.wav|It had been in place since last July.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_429.wav|It's a miracle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_430.wav|The first minister is obviously concerned to hear about this incident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_431.wav|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_432.wav|They will form a tribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_433.wav|The whole region is in shock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p257/p257_434.wav|The bill would be massive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_025.wav|Johnson was pretty low.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_026.wav|It's nice to hear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_027.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_028.wav|They should be so lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_029.wav|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_030.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_031.wav|Because we do not need it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_032.wav|He took me on a tour of the wards.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_033.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_034.wav|I'd like to continue that record.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_035.wav|It was clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_036.wav|It is not for any other purpose.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_037.wav|President Bush is at war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_038.wav|I was scared.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_039.wav|It will come all right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_040.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_041.wav|The judge said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_042.wav|We need to chat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_043.wav|It's a blessing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_044.wav|As she explains.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_045.wav|She looked so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_046.wav|He looks like an Afghan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_047.wav|It is the whole package.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_048.wav|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_049.wav|We were surprised to see the photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_050.wav|That's the day job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_051.wav|We have not given up hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_052.wav|You must have a government and a good civil service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_053.wav|That is very hard, alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_054.wav|It's that kind of place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_055.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_056.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_057.wav|He was popular.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_058.wav|It should be devolved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_059.wav|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_060.wav|Try to save us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_061.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_062.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_063.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_064.wav|That was the easy election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_065.wav|It's all I can do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_066.wav|The price cuts are really exciting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_067.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_068.wav|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_069.wav|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_070.wav|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_071.wav|He got the same story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_072.wav|This is the way things should be handled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_073.wav|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_074.wav|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_075.wav|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_076.wav|I first met him last summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_077.wav|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_078.wav|Nothing is yet confirmed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_079.wav|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_080.wav|We have other options.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_081.wav|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_082.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_083.wav|Today I couldn't run on it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_084.wav|They are different types.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_085.wav|It is a simple equation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_086.wav|Until you hit the big games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_087.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_088.wav|There was no rescue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_089.wav|She's got to say something.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_090.wav|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_091.wav|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_092.wav|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_093.wav|Journalists should make him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_094.wav|But it was a pleasure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_095.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_096.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_097.wav|It is a good lifestyle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_098.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_099.wav|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_100.wav|It's not perfect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_101.wav|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_102.wav|She has been shot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_103.wav|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_104.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_105.wav|We do not expect any surplus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_106.wav|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_107.wav|It is so sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_108.wav|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_109.wav|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_110.wav|This film will be totally awesome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_111.wav|Maybe this battle has been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_112.wav|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_113.wav|I joined a group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_114.wav|This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_115.wav|Who would have?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_116.wav|It is a delight on every level.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_117.wav|You can spend money on housing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_118.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_119.wav|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_120.wav|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_121.wav|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_122.wav|It has removed a bit of guilt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_123.wav|She does not want to speak.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_124.wav|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_125.wav|So the European elections are extremely important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_126.wav|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_127.wav|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_128.wav|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_129.wav|The move has provoked a mixed response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_130.wav|The role was perfect for Russell.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_131.wav|It plans to return to this field.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_132.wav|They made such decisions in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_133.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_134.wav|My conscience is not clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_135.wav|I am totally devoted to this job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_136.wav|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_137.wav|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_138.wav|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_139.wav|Is that Titanic?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_140.wav|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_141.wav|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_142.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_143.wav|You know the type.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_144.wav|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_145.wav|The FBI could become involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_146.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_147.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_148.wav|My Dad is a hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_149.wav|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_150.wav|Neither side can win this war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_151.wav|Was this element always there?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_152.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_153.wav|I've put my own money into this project.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_154.wav|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_155.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_156.wav|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_157.wav|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_158.wav|We have to move forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_159.wav|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_160.wav|We try to keep it right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_161.wav|It's that sort of night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_162.wav|I lost my head.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_163.wav|It is not too late to get on board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_164.wav|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_165.wav|That will do for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_166.wav|They thought they had found a home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_167.wav|I always felt they played for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_168.wav|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_169.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_170.wav|IT S the real thing, for sure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_171.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_172.wav|If that's the case, he will struggle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_173.wav|It should be easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_174.wav|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_175.wav|I drove the ball well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_176.wav|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_177.wav|I've been there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_178.wav|They will run a mile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_179.wav|Four policemen were wounded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_180.wav|They receive a high profile in the media.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_181.wav|We did everything by the book.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_182.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_183.wav|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_184.wav|We want to help them through it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_185.wav|It is a terrible loss.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_186.wav|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_187.wav|The procedure is the same in all cases.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_188.wav|If the director is with you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_189.wav|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_190.wav|I grew up listening to these people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_191.wav|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_192.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_193.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_194.wav|It's the same old story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_195.wav|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_196.wav|Is that success?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_197.wav|Ferguson should take note.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_198.wav|They've got three-quarters of the way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_199.wav|But she might be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_200.wav|A deadline is still essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_201.wav|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_202.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_203.wav|It's a mixture of everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_204.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_205.wav|We have an election in eight days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_206.wav|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_207.wav|Feel the heat?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_208.wav|He is slightly confused.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_209.wav|She should not be blamed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_210.wav|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_211.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_212.wav|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_213.wav|His third goal was superb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_214.wav|It's not ideal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_215.wav|We want to keep the pound.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_216.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_217.wav|He seemed to lose his focus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_218.wav|I might come back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_219.wav|His death was a tragic accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_220.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_221.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_222.wav|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_223.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_224.wav|It's so special.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_225.wav|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_226.wav|What was the main difference?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_227.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_228.wav|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_229.wav|They are the innocent victims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_230.wav|My wife and family are the support system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_231.wav|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_232.wav|They tried to give her advice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_233.wav|They had no children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_234.wav|We are in the hat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_235.wav|They should come forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_236.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_237.wav|It's quite nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_238.wav|Hospitals are for the ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_239.wav|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_240.wav|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_241.wav|They are all bright and different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_242.wav|It is hard won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_243.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_244.wav|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_245.wav|You can feel at home in China.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_246.wav|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_247.wav|It's a record label, not a form of music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_248.wav|I was shocked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_249.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_250.wav|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_251.wav|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_252.wav|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_253.wav|Her presence was almost everywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_254.wav|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_255.wav|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_256.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_257.wav|They are interior designers and architects.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_258.wav|Chelsea was a great club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_259.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_260.wav|I was in jail for five years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_261.wav|I am very angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_262.wav|They must play for each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_263.wav|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_264.wav|It is also very valuable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_265.wav|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_266.wav|It's all change on the music scene in Manchester.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_267.wav|I saw one body.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_268.wav|That's the only thing I will say.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_269.wav|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_270.wav|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_271.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_272.wav|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_273.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_274.wav|It is the same in Sweden.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_275.wav|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_276.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_277.wav|They were all in a stable condition last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_278.wav|It's a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_279.wav|The record companies have gone through the floor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_280.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_281.wav|He has a wealth of experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_282.wav|It's so awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_283.wav|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_284.wav|I intended to look for another club on loan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_285.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_286.wav|This is a national crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_287.wav|The death toll included five children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_288.wav|He was obviously very genuine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_289.wav|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_290.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_291.wav|The results are sometimes contentious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_292.wav|These figures are truly awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_293.wav|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_294.wav|Sunday's game was not a trial.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_295.wav|A new school will be built.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_296.wav|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_297.wav|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_298.wav|The home was now under new management.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_299.wav|Graeme was prepared.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_300.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_301.wav|Nothing is safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_302.wav|One was a lawyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_303.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_304.wav|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_305.wav|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_306.wav|This is a war over our home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_307.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_308.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_309.wav|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_310.wav|It's certainly different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_311.wav|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_312.wav|He will go a long way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_313.wav|We want to play at the worlds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_314.wav|Scotland were beaten again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_315.wav|They were fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_316.wav|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_317.wav|Kids are terrible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_318.wav|It should be equal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_319.wav|The problems began a long time ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_320.wav|My body is clearly capable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_321.wav|Referees are easy targets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_322.wav|He said she was mad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_323.wav|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_324.wav|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_325.wav|However, the groups denied the claims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_326.wav|There was some merit in that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_327.wav|I came into this world with nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_328.wav|It is a strong case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_329.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_330.wav|Off with their heads.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_331.wav|I am so upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_332.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_333.wav|Robert is a special talent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_334.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_335.wav|There was no option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_336.wav|They haven't got a hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_337.wav|He did a good job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_338.wav|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_339.wav|It was so new, so exciting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_340.wav|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_341.wav|Indeed, it was magical.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_342.wav|I've got no secret.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_343.wav|There's no place to hide.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_344.wav|Tiger is the exception.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_345.wav|Nobody else was with me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_346.wav|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_347.wav|The composer will conduct.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_348.wav|His contract was then not renewed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_349.wav|I got a yellow card.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_350.wav|It is long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_351.wav|Eight months later, he was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_352.wav|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_353.wav|I saw some good things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_354.wav|The salary changes are long overdue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_355.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_356.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_357.wav|It was very formal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_358.wav|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_359.wav|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_360.wav|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_361.wav|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_362.wav|We will be homeless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_363.wav|That would help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_364.wav|It was fit for royalty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_365.wav|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_366.wav|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_367.wav|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_368.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_369.wav|I feel pretty good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_370.wav|I am a star.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_371.wav|He could make it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_372.wav|I thought he was my friend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_373.wav|He could face a jail sentence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_374.wav|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_375.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_376.wav|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_377.wav|Well, the big day has arrived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_378.wav|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_379.wav|Not because they want to sing about something.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_380.wav|Colour was at the core of his life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_381.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_382.wav|It was a cry for help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_383.wav|Something is wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_384.wav|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_385.wav|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_386.wav|That team is due to be announced this morning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_387.wav|That's the name of the game, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_388.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_389.wav|I was so nervous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_390.wav|YOU thought it was a headache.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_391.wav|There is a solution, she believes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_392.wav|However, it's good to turn the page.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_393.wav|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_394.wav|This year I understood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_395.wav|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_396.wav|I suspect the latter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_397.wav|These guys are looking for business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_398.wav|He is on the wrong side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_399.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_400.wav|The car was just there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_401.wav|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_402.wav|It is full-scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_403.wav|My house was shaking at the time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_404.wav|Then , he laughs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_405.wav|They are not left wing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_406.wav|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_407.wav|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_408.wav|He scored a touchdown.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_409.wav|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_410.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_411.wav|I believe the gap is nearly there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_412.wav|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_413.wav|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p258/p258_414.wav|Also, it is the season of goodwill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_001.wav|Please call Stella.  )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_025.wav|But it could prove disastrous.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_026.wav|Smoking is also very important.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_027.wav|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_028.wav|I am pretty careful with money.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_029.wav|He has the courage of the unaware.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_030.wav|I could not do it.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_031.wav|Everyone can have their opinion.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_032.wav|The function of the clerk is to provide advice.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_033.wav|We speak about the performance.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_034.wav|She is employed on short-term contracts.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_035.wav|Because he was born in England.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_039.wav|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_040.wav|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_042.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_043.wav|Several investments have already been made.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_044.wav|The boy is no longer with us.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_045.wav|Among them are many criminals.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_046.wav|Merger would be entirely logical.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_047.wav|He looks like an Afghan.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_048.wav|They had to explain it.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_049.wav|I had come back from London.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_050.wav|Pulled a huge number of viewers.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_051.wav|I had trouble with the producers.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_052.wav|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_053.wav|We have not given up hope.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_054.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_055.wav|The problems are a result of that shortfall.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_056.wav|They had been in Scotland on exercise.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_057.wav|Let's hope that it does.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_058.wav|We have to keep our clients.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_059.wav|He also has a Scottish grandfather.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_064.wav|It wasn't possible to relax.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_065.wav|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_066.wav|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_067.wav|She died in hospital two hours later.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_068.wav|It is a job creation scheme.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_070.wav|Even the one she loved.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_071.wav|Today it was really enjoyable.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_072.wav|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_073.wav|It was a unanimous decision.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_074.wav|It makes for an interesting conference.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_075.wav|I've had it for the exams.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_076.wav|I first met him last summer.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_077.wav|I wanted to change the formula.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_078.wav|It gave no further details.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_079.wav|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_080.wav|Our mother is very worried.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_084.wav|It is normal for me.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_085.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_086.wav|How are you, sir ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_087.wav|So is that it, then ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_088.wav|Do I have a favourite ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_089.wav|What do we do ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_090.wav|Why do it otherwise ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_091.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_092.wav|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_093.wav|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_094.wav|Collaboration is also encouraged by the Medical Research Council and other bodies.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_095.wav|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_096.wav|We would have concerns about that.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_097.wav|Ferguson must take the blame.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_098.wav|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_099.wav|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_100.wav|It was clear on Thursday.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_101.wav|I did not have a bet on myself.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_102.wav|The selection process is still at a very early stage.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_103.wav|It's good to have a voice.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_104.wav|They will remember this victory for a while.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_105.wav|But they must believe in themselves.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_106.wav|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_107.wav|The following are the principal provisions.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_108.wav|It is a good lifestyle.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_109.wav|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_110.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_111.wav|Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_112.wav|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_113.wav|He was jailed for a year.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_114.wav|The whole thing is the music.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_115.wav|New Year will be very busy.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_116.wav|The result is a vacuum.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_117.wav|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_118.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_119.wav|We have the mental strength.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_120.wav|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_121.wav|That admission is not surprising.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_122.wav|In addition, investor choice is reduced.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_123.wav|We had another last Tuesday.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_124.wav|It is too pretty, it is too small.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_125.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_126.wav|We did what we had to do.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_127.wav|But it is different in different regions.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_128.wav|They made such decisions in London.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_129.wav|Tiger is not the norm.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_130.wav|It is a variable condition and the diagnosis is difficult.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_131.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_132.wav|I am totally devoted to this job.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_133.wav|Before it was an ordeal.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_134.wav|It could be done by experts and lawyers.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_135.wav|Reaction to the device was mixed.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_136.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_137.wav|It was started almost by accident.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_138.wav|Scotland will finish the group in second place.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_139.wav|I think he's the favourite, no question.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_140.wav|I'm so grateful for that.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_141.wav|But she was very human.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_142.wav|What happened in that game ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_143.wav|Are you going to win ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_144.wav|Was it the wife ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_145.wav|Why change it ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_146.wav|What do we want to do that for ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_147.wav|Does the name matter ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_148.wav|how do you get it back ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_149.wav|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_150.wav|The referee faces a massive job.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_151.wav|His second goal was equally impressive.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_152.wav|He was seen as the enemy.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_153.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_154.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_155.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_156.wav|So I got a blood test.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_157.wav|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_158.wav|I haven't made any definite decisions.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_159.wav|The two companies were not for sale.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_160.wav|People were actually not on his side.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_161.wav|We have to speed up the process.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_162.wav|There's only one team in Ayrshire.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_163.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_164.wav|Nothing was meant by it.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_165.wav|Behind him was his brother.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_166.wav|It was by the numbers.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_167.wav|The woman was his wife.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_168.wav|This action reflects a slump in bookings.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_169.wav|He was right into football from an early age.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_170.wav|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_171.wav|It's never great to finish second.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_172.wav|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_173.wav|We have a budget in March.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_174.wav|Adventure is the champagne of life.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_175.wav|US is the only country to vote against resolution.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_176.wav|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_177.wav|The people are the hero.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_178.wav|I always felt they played for me.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_179.wav|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_180.wav|The second aspect was the fear of failure.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_181.wav|Phase one was a shambles.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_182.wav|If that's the case, he will struggle.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_183.wav|It is vital to clarify their role.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_184.wav|I'm just going to hit the shot.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_185.wav|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_186.wav|Each case is treated on merit.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_187.wav|It is only the beginning.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_188.wav|He played it like a veteran.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_189.wav|Our destiny is in our own hands.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_190.wav|That's not fair to the supporters.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_191.wav|We've just had it confirmed.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_192.wav|I will have to order its destruction.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_193.wav|You know the sort of thing.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_194.wav|I cannot say too much about them.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_195.wav|But there's an upturn in the sector.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_196.wav|It shows the strength of the roots.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_197.wav|I'm interested in interesting work.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_198.wav|Shelter also supports the reform.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_199.wav|We represent a wide range of society.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_200.wav|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_201.wav|It caused a lot of upset.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_202.wav|It had little effect on European equity markets.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_203.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_204.wav|It's very difficult to find a buyer.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_205.wav|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_206.wav|In due course we will make an announcement.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_207.wav|He should emerge as the winner.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_208.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_209.wav|And they were being paid ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_210.wav|was everything done to save people ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_211.wav|What was the matter for concern ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_212.wav|Do I think about them often ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_213.wav|Is it in the right place ?)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_220.wav|The result is utterly compelling.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_221.wav|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_222.wav|This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_223.wav|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_224.wav|Little is known about them.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_225.wav|I won't make an official complaint.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_226.wav|It was worth a photograph.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_227.wav|The move follows a review of the Singapore)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_228.wav|We have an election in eight days.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_232.wav|Today we must not repeat that mistake.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_233.wav|From there, they can go anywhere.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_234.wav|I am delighted for Simon.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_235.wav|It had all been arranged.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_236.wav|My daughter is an adult.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_237.wav|His third goal was superb.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_238.wav|It was finally agreed on Saturday.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_239.wav|They are difficult awards to decide.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_240.wav|I am considered a teenager.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_241.wav|Anyway, the job will be part-time.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_242.wav|He must get to know himself.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_243.wav|The transaction is not feasible.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_244.wav|People should make their own decisions.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_245.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_248.wav|His background is firmly in venture capital.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_249.wav|It's easy to be negative about these things.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_250.wav|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_251.wav|The scientific debate is dead.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_264.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_265.wav|Did it work ?)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_270.wav|He was good, but not that good.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_271.wav|He said the right things.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_272.wav|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_273.wav|I have received no explanation.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_288.wav|It is probably in the culture.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_289.wav|On the contrary they stand to gain.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_290.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_294.wav|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_295.wav|They must play for each other.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_296.wav|These figures are truly terrible.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_297.wav|I felt about this big.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_298.wav|It is also very valuable.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_300.wav|The stage was set for a showdown.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_301.wav|This could put pressure on UK inflation.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_308.wav|Blair also had a penalty.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_309.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_310.wav|I understand the security issue.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_311.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_312.wav|It seemed a logical expansion.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_313.wav|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_314.wav|It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_315.wav|It's hard to see it.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_316.wav|The record companies have gone through the floor.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_317.wav|This would provide a significant and welcome boost for local employment.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_318.wav|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_319.wav|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_320.wav|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_321.wav|The circumstances have changed since last year.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_322.wav|We will deliver at director level.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_323.wav|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_324.wav|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_325.wav|We would hope to make progress on that next year.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_326.wav|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_327.wav|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_328.wav|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_329.wav|I was just so determined.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_330.wav|No Briton has ever won.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_331.wav|Are they free ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_332.wav|What are they for ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_333.wav|Is there a waiting list ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_334.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_335.wav|So what happens next ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_336.wav|Had this been common practice ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_337.wav|What do they want us to do ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_338.wav|Is it worth it ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_339.wav|His appeal is instantly understood.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_340.wav|The results are sometimes contentious.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_341.wav|The songs are just so good.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_342.wav|This will save interest charges.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_343.wav|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_344.wav|Sunday's game was not a trial.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_345.wav|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_346.wav|McNaughton was not so sure.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_347.wav|Job losses were also announced.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_348.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_349.wav|The party lasted all night.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_350.wav|The pound has also suffered.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_351.wav|Scotland has shown the way.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_352.wav|There will be good prospects ahead.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_353.wav|We think the timing is good.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_354.wav|He will go a long way.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_355.wav|We want to play at the worlds.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_356.wav|Other people had looked at it.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_357.wav|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_358.wav|I didn't have the reply.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_359.wav|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_360.wav|You may have a short memory.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_361.wav|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_362.wav|A Home Office spokesman said.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_363.wav|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_364.wav|It's too horrible to think.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_365.wav|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_366.wav|Industrial action has to hurt.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_367.wav|Nobody said it was required.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_368.wav|It was tough to contain the excitement.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_369.wav|They promised to fight the plans.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_370.wav|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_371.wav|He was unable to come.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_372.wav|He was at school in Devon.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_373.wav|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_374.wav|Finally came the moment of truth.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_375.wav|Whether this return was too soon.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_376.wav|Neither man has been charged.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_377.wav|An alternative must be offered.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_378.wav|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_379.wav|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_380.wav|He can handle it without any problem.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_381.wav|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_382.wav|He is an excellent manager.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_383.wav|I think we'll just keep it.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_384.wav|The Allies intend to maintain the average.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_385.wav|I've always been a sensitive.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_386.wav|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_387.wav|He had no previous convictions.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_388.wav|It was a massive error of judgment.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_389.wav|They should take their mobile phones.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_390.wav|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_391.wav|They have broken that promise.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_392.wav|Does it matter ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_393.wav|How do you take them away ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_394.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_395.wav|After the match, do you ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_396.wav|That is a crazy situation.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_397.wav|We are really good friends.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_398.wav|The principle is quite clear.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_399.wav|The salary changes are long overdue.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_400.wav|The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_401.wav|She said they would appeal.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_402.wav|They were to blame for the first two goals.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_403.wav|It would be quite nice.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_404.wav|This remains the party's policy.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_405.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_406.wav|The parties include the Scottish Executive.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_407.wav|We will win the argument.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_408.wav|Everything is now in place for Manchester.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_409.wav|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_410.wav|The team hadn't been picked.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_411.wav|The prosecution say the girl was the only witness to the attack.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_412.wav|It sounds like a wish list.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_413.wav|The director will be present.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_414.wav|It is the nature of his party.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_415.wav|Theatre is not a museum.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_416.wav|We have very limited capacity.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_417.wav|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_418.wav|My view has now completely changed.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_419.wav|I had a fortunate war.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_420.wav|It's too close to call.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_421.wav|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_422.wav|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_423.wav|I've had a wonderful career.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_424.wav|The BBC was a disgrace.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_425.wav|It is hard to understand.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_426.wav|But the foundations have been laid.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_427.wav|There was an element of frustration.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_428.wav|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_429.wav|The casualties were not named.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_430.wav|The next few months will tell.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_431.wav|It is not over by any means.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_432.wav|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_433.wav|Three years ago he would have been.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_434.wav|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_435.wav|I watch the other visitors.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_436.wav|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_437.wav|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_438.wav|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_439.wav|There is a solution, she believes.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_440.wav|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_441.wav|It was submitted without their knowledge.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_442.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_443.wav|My aim is a top six finish.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_444.wav|It means an enormous amount.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_445.wav|Such an attack is bizarre.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_446.wav|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_447.wav|I never had a childhood.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_448.wav|No-one wanted to run it tonight.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_449.wav|None of the pieces was commissioned.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_450.wav|There is another important factor.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_451.wav|I never found my rhythm.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_452.wav|In fact, the reasons are simple.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_453.wav|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_454.wav|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_455.wav|Nobody has told the story.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_456.wav|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_457.wav|He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_458.wav|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_459.wav|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_460.wav|It is pretty bad news.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_461.wav|It certainly appeared that way.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_462.wav|We put our bid in last night.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_463.wav|Quality was high in all sections.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_464.wav|It could cause a little bit of disruption.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_465.wav|But we have built a platform for next season.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_466.wav|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_467.wav|They offer a kind of narrative.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_468.wav|She came to the Highland Show.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_469.wav|It was like someone had died.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_470.wav|They were good years for him.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_471.wav|Let that be their memorial.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_472.wav|Then came the farewell to Europe.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_473.wav|I'm very passionate about my country.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_474.wav|Phil Mickelson did that last year.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_475.wav|There was no trouble at all.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_476.wav|He deserved a red card.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_477.wav|The price paid for it was not disclosed.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_478.wav|You have to have a proven track record to get them.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_479.wav|Some problems were too complex.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_480.wav|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p259/p259_481.wav|The chief constable has retired.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_025.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_026.wav|We will be homeless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_027.wav|Is this accurate?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_028.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_029.wav|They have no history.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_030.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_031.wav|I'd just like to play.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_032.wav|There's a story, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_033.wav|This is the window.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_034.wav|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_035.wav|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_036.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_037.wav|It's a fact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_038.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_039.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_040.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_041.wav|Dancing was her life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_042.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_043.wav|We will push.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_044.wav|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_045.wav|Among them are many criminals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_046.wav|It is marvellous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_047.wav|Every aspect of our play was first class.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_048.wav|Our people are ready.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_049.wav|Here's a clue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_050.wav|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_051.wav|I was inspired by two things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_052.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_053.wav|My fitness was very poor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_054.wav|Sadly, it can't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_055.wav|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_056.wav|I expect a rapid response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_057.wav|What was the main difference?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_058.wav|There's a danger.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_059.wav|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_060.wav|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_061.wav|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_062.wav|It's that kind of place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_063.wav|They are real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_064.wav|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_065.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_066.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_067.wav|That was a gold medal for certain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_068.wav|We should have known.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_069.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_070.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_071.wav|He was at home with his pals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_072.wav|It was magic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_073.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_074.wav|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_075.wav|Is there a new way forward?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_076.wav|The party is up for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_077.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_078.wav|People must remain vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_079.wav|Today she has been released.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_080.wav|Who will pay for this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_081.wav|He had taken everything from me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_082.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_083.wav|By then, he was walking on water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_084.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_085.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_086.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_087.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_088.wav|It is a lifeline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_089.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_090.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_091.wav|She is an expert on medical ethics.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_092.wav|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_093.wav|Then came the crunch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_094.wav|It is annoying.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_095.wav|I love the Dome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_096.wav|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_097.wav|I am extremely sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_098.wav|It is a love affair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_099.wav|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_100.wav|May not have been at fault?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_101.wav|They tried to deny it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_102.wav|They make a selective perception process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_103.wav|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_104.wav|That's all right then.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_105.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_106.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_107.wav|She reflects a bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_108.wav|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_109.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_110.wav|It was a funny game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_111.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_112.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_113.wav|It was the eighties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_114.wav|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_115.wav|It is so sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_116.wav|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_117.wav|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_118.wav|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_119.wav|It is rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_120.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_121.wav|We enjoyed it today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_122.wav|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_123.wav|There were no grounds for his action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_124.wav|I can't even get into the A team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_125.wav|She really suffered for her art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_126.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_127.wav|The people will come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_128.wav|No production was achieved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_129.wav|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_130.wav|It plans to return to this field.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_131.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_132.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_133.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_134.wav|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_135.wav|I don't know the full story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_136.wav|It seems so long since I did the exams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_137.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_138.wav|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_139.wav|I was awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_140.wav|The idea is simple.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_141.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_142.wav|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_143.wav|It is not just about pay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_144.wav|Note the date.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_145.wav|So I got a blood test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_146.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_147.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_148.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_149.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_150.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_151.wav|I was on a roll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_152.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_153.wav|We are on a four-year mission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_154.wav|My Dad is a hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_155.wav|He was asked to quit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_156.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_157.wav|He can do no wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_158.wav|Was this element always there?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_159.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_160.wav|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_161.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_162.wav|They are not advertised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_163.wav|Seven people were later detained by police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_164.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_165.wav|Again, we were lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_166.wav|They will do their own thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_167.wav|Does that put pressure on us?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_168.wav|One season, they might do well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_169.wav|Is Saddam a threat?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_170.wav|As we worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_171.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_172.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_173.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_174.wav|I'm just going to hit the shot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_175.wav|Everyone can be bought.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_176.wav|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_177.wav|I've been there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_178.wav|Four policemen were wounded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_179.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_180.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_181.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_182.wav|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_183.wav|Our team is just so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_184.wav|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_185.wav|It is a farce.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_186.wav|Peace was won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_187.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_188.wav|I came home by ambulance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_189.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_190.wav|Is that success?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_191.wav|They are ready.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_192.wav|I have a cold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_193.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_194.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_195.wav|It's all about money, money, money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_196.wav|There was no safety net.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_197.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_198.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_199.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_200.wav|There was an e-mail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_201.wav|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_202.wav|I am delighted for Simon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_203.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_204.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_205.wav|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_206.wav|It's not ideal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_207.wav|In each case they were a goal down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_208.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_209.wav|I might come back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_210.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_211.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_212.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_213.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_214.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_215.wav|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_216.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_217.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_218.wav|It's not before time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_219.wav|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_220.wav|The report is due out next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_221.wav|But she was.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_222.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_223.wav|My wife and family are the support system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_224.wav|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_225.wav|We were awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_226.wav|They tried to give her advice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_227.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_228.wav|The parties have been given until today to respond.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_229.wav|There is no excuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_230.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_231.wav|But it's a subtle process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_232.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_233.wav|The car was just there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_234.wav|The whole thing will be great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_235.wav|Our policy is clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_236.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_237.wav|You can feel at home in China.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_238.wav|The scene is about this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_239.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_240.wav|It was a kind of contempt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_241.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_242.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_243.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_244.wav|It was a hit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_245.wav|There's the mix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_246.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_247.wav|Is there on his hands?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_248.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_249.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_250.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_251.wav|Chelsea was a great club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_252.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_253.wav|We have to expand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_254.wav|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_255.wav|Is that a serious question?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_256.wav|They must play for each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_257.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_258.wav|There's not much money in cycling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_259.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_260.wav|I am just trying to do my job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_261.wav|This is a question of Islam.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_262.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_263.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_264.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_265.wav|The system can work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_266.wav|We're in shock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_267.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_268.wav|It's a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_269.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_270.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_274.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_275.wav|If not, he should go home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_276.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_277.wav|We are a grandmother.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_278.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_279.wav|You feel very helpless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_280.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_281.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_282.wav|He will address the nation this evening.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_283.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_284.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_285.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_286.wav|This is a national crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_287.wav|Bombing slaughter rejected
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_288.wav|We are not going to forget.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_289.wav|No Briton has ever won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_290.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_291.wav|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_292.wav|The songs are just so good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_293.wav|And it's a goodbye from him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_294.wav|The goals will come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_295.wav|Who can predict?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_296.wav|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_297.wav|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_298.wav|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_299.wav|I was the sheep.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_300.wav|What has altered?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_301.wav|Nothing is safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_302.wav|One was a lawyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_303.wav|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_304.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_305.wav|They are wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_306.wav|I can live with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_307.wav|Work has started.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_308.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_309.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_310.wav|You should be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_311.wav|The minister is the engineer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_312.wav|The letters are going out today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_313.wav|We want to play at the worlds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_314.wav|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_315.wav|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_316.wav|Special measures were needed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_317.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_318.wav|The show is at an end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_319.wav|Your father was a good man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_320.wav|Such actions are rarely popular.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_321.wav|We have got to get the points from this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_322.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_323.wav|Henman has been warned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_324.wav|I would love it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_326.wav|The problems began a long time ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_327.wav|For the moment, our position remains the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_328.wav|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_329.wav|We are in the end game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_330.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_331.wav|There was no time scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_332.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_333.wav|It is a job creation scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_334.wav|Relief was beyond belief.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_335.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_336.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_337.wav|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_338.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_339.wav|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_340.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_341.wav|He was the architect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_342.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_343.wav|He has to learn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_344.wav|Two people were interviewed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_345.wav|I've got no secret.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_346.wav|This is a big advantage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_347.wav|I'm very lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_348.wav|A great deal has been achieved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_349.wav|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_350.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_351.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_352.wav|They should take their mobile phones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_353.wav|Eight months later, he was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_354.wav|I HAVE a dream.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_355.wav|We have big ideas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_356.wav|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p260/p260_357.wav|I first met him last summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_025.wav|They are very clever in their use of words.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_026.wav|Meetings will also remain private.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_027.wav|Because we do not need it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_028.wav|Life was like a timetable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_029.wav|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_030.wav|We will look into it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_031.wav|I have never been a member of the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_032.wav|It was a close call.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_033.wav|That means an extra two years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_034.wav|This film will be totally awesome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_035.wav|That was the case with David.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_036.wav|He is believed to live in Britain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_037.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_038.wav|This represents a tough game for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_039.wav|Their campaign is in disarray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_040.wav|Among them are many criminals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_041.wav|I was released after six days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_042.wav|That's been the difference between the sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_043.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_044.wav|I would love to have him home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_045.wav|He will need that machine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_046.wav|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_047.wav|It had little effect on European equity markets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_048.wav|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_049.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_050.wav|There was no safety net.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_051.wav|I must take a seat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_052.wav|It is on the news.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_053.wav|The motive for the shooting was not known.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_054.wav|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_055.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_056.wav|We will pay their bills.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_057.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_058.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_059.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_060.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_061.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_062.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_063.wav|Only water is currently allowed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_064.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_065.wav|It's not covered by the insurance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_066.wav|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_067.wav|That's not the intention at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_068.wav|It starts with the script.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_069.wav|There could be a way back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_070.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_071.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_072.wav|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_073.wav|The price cuts are really exciting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_074.wav|He is now resident in England.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_075.wav|These people are not big names.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_076.wav|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_077.wav|He is in the queue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_078.wav|Both agreed on the success of the event.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_079.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_080.wav|We have to offer value for money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_081.wav|Our mother is very worried.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_082.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_083.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_084.wav|Potions said he would drive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_085.wav|They deserve a lot of credit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_086.wav|However, it did not end that way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_087.wav|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_088.wav|It is high time to act.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_089.wav|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_090.wav|However, on this showing it's going to be a difficult task.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_091.wav|We could not get any possession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_092.wav|It was clear on Thursday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_093.wav|But it is up again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_094.wav|All the pressure will be on him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_095.wav|You are like an animal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_096.wav|The move follows a review of the Singapore
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_097.wav|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_098.wav|I had a ball today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_099.wav|No, the equipment is extra.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_100.wav|It is a good lifestyle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_101.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_102.wav|We are also looking for new licences.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_103.wav|Our house was very small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_104.wav|It was a funny game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_105.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_106.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_107.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_108.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_109.wav|And does it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_110.wav|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_111.wav|I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_112.wav|It became a national network.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_113.wav|He thought she was amazing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_114.wav|Maybe this battle has been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_115.wav|It isn't a happy memory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_116.wav|Actors like to be in the centre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_117.wav|It's not a quick fix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_118.wav|But it took a lot of bottle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_119.wav|Structural changes were also required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_120.wav|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_121.wav|It is too pretty, it is too small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_122.wav|I was on a roll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_123.wav|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_124.wav|My life has changed a lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_125.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_126.wav|That would open the gates of hell.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_127.wav|He can perform well under pressure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_128.wav|I have accepted the challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_129.wav|You are a gambling man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_130.wav|He is a great addition to our team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_131.wav|This is a successful outcome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_132.wav|I love the spectacle of cinema.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_133.wav|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_134.wav|We will try to find someone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_135.wav|The others have all been in storage for some time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_136.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_137.wav|We could easily have lost that game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_138.wav|Check that he is dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_139.wav|Several messages can be taken from the occasion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_140.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_141.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_142.wav|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_143.wav|The balance isn't there at EMI.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_144.wav|I would relish the prospect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_145.wav|It has become a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_146.wav|Like the others, he was arrested.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_147.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_148.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_149.wav|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_150.wav|It was by the numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_151.wav|But I am still awaiting an answer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_152.wav|We will turn the corner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_153.wav|He was asked to quit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_154.wav|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_155.wav|The strong pound also took its toll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_156.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_157.wav|The bank was now involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_158.wav|We have to move forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_159.wav|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_160.wav|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_161.wav|The pension levels will remain the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_162.wav|I would probably have to agree with him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_163.wav|You had to go and see him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_164.wav|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_165.wav|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_166.wav|The region is open for business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_167.wav|They could not match it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_168.wav|What happened in that game ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_169.wav|Are you going to win ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_170.wav|Was it the wife ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_171.wav|Why change it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_172.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_173.wav|This is no reflection on Rangers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_174.wav|I always felt they played for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_175.wav|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_176.wav|It is a body blow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_177.wav|The jury is still out.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_178.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_179.wav|City sentiment is in his favour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_180.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_181.wav|These men could be anywhere in the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_182.wav|I will be in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_183.wav|Says the Duke of York.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_184.wav|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_185.wav|I had too much to drink.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_186.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_187.wav|He prefers to play for them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_188.wav|That is a waste of energy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_189.wav|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_190.wav|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_191.wav|That was the theory, anyway.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_192.wav|It was a pre-emptive strike.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_193.wav|It had been in place since last July.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_194.wav|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_195.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_196.wav|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_197.wav|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_198.wav|He should emerge as the winner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_199.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_200.wav|I made a terrible start.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_201.wav|It was a moment of madness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_202.wav|We believe a third party was involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_203.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_204.wav|It was his own decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_205.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_206.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_207.wav|What are you not good at ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_208.wav|I think, therefore I am ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_209.wav|Who was she ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_210.wav|A deadline is still essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_211.wav|I chose to go by the rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_212.wav|I won't make an official complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_213.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_214.wav|They are looking at a flotation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_215.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_216.wav|We have an election in eight days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_217.wav|It was far from business as usual.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_218.wav|All will be revealed in due course.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_219.wav|They have known the hard times.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_220.wav|It has been like that all year for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_221.wav|Construction is due to begin in February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_222.wav|Seven people were critically injured.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_223.wav|My daughter is an adult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_224.wav|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_225.wav|He must get to know himself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_226.wav|It was a day for records.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_227.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_228.wav|And the World Cup has not even begun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_229.wav|Life is too short to be bitter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_230.wav|A terrorist is a terrorist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_231.wav|It could be to do with the location.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_232.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_233.wav|The statement contained no surprises.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_234.wav|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_235.wav|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_236.wav|They have not been in touch with the club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_237.wav|I need a publishing deal!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_238.wav|They tried to give her advice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_239.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_240.wav|Of course, that is not the whole story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_241.wav|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_242.wav|This is a family club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_243.wav|It is the loss of my name.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_244.wav|I haven't made the donation yet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_245.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_246.wav|The irony was not lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_247.wav|We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_248.wav|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_249.wav|I was just a kid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_250.wav|It is now the big brother.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_251.wav|They showed a lot of heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_252.wav|Nato was not a love affair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_253.wav|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_254.wav|It was a poor performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_255.wav|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_256.wav|We want to play at the worlds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_257.wav|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_258.wav|We will listen to any suggestion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_259.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_260.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_261.wav|No production contract is yet in sight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_262.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_263.wav|It seems a shame to leave it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_264.wav|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_265.wav|This idea has been around for four years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_266.wav|The concerns are the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_267.wav|I can't get a job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_268.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_269.wav|was everything done to save people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_270.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_271.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_272.wav|Is it in the right place ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_273.wav|Did he trip ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_274.wav|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_275.wav|I was ready for this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_276.wav|They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_277.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_278.wav|They are interior designers and architects.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_279.wav|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_280.wav|The Scotch whisky industry is absent from the agenda.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_281.wav|The offer will run for the next three weekends.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_282.wav|At first I thought I was gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_283.wav|I am just trying to do my job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_284.wav|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_285.wav|We're trying to get rounded performers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_286.wav|They can leave at any time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_287.wav|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_288.wav|It would be a tragedy if it had to close.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_289.wav|He has not created a Festival resource.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_290.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_291.wav|He has run a hell of a race.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_292.wav|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_293.wav|He was also married with two children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_294.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_295.wav|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_296.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_297.wav|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_298.wav|A senior party insider said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_299.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_300.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_301.wav|This will help our confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_302.wav|The two companies were not for sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_303.wav|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_304.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_305.wav|The cause of the accident remained unclear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_306.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_307.wav|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_308.wav|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_309.wav|We will deliver at director level.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_310.wav|Size is not the issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_311.wav|He will address the nation this evening.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_312.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_313.wav|Tony Blair said as little.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_314.wav|His was a huge success story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_315.wav|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_316.wav|That is the general feeling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_317.wav|Holland won by five wickets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_318.wav|He was obviously very genuine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_319.wav|The casting is as perfect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_320.wav|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_321.wav|A Home Office spokesman said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_322.wav|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_323.wav|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_324.wav|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_325.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_326.wav|It is a potential danger.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_327.wav|Cast Away now on general release.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_328.wav|That could bring the peace process to a standstill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_329.wav|The City welcomed the numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_330.wav|You will never get a conviction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_331.wav|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_332.wav|That meant the search was unlawful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_333.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_334.wav|There will be good prospects ahead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_335.wav|I would do away with the dress code.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_336.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_337.wav|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_338.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_339.wav|What form did that take ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_340.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_341.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_342.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_343.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_344.wav|So what happens next ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_345.wav|This ruling is a farce.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_346.wav|Both men were on one-year contracts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_347.wav|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_348.wav|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_349.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_350.wav|Thousands of British tourists were trapped in their hotels.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_351.wav|The whole family was in shock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_352.wav|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_353.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_354.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_355.wav|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_356.wav|I've got a sense of humour, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_357.wav|Her life is now back on track.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_358.wav|There was some merit in that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_359.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_360.wav|It's too horrible to think.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_361.wav|They are now out in the cold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_362.wav|At first, the youngster was not keen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_363.wav|My view has now completely changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_364.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_365.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_366.wav|He is not very big, either.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_367.wav|Finally came the moment of truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_368.wav|Neither man has been charged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_369.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_370.wav|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_371.wav|He did a good job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_372.wav|Had this been common practice ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_373.wav|What do they want us to do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_374.wav|Is it worth it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_375.wav|Does it matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_376.wav|He took a draw on his cigarette.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_377.wav|I am a lucky man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_378.wav|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_379.wav|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_380.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_381.wav|You did not see it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_382.wav|Alex Ferguson is the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_383.wav|They should take their mobile phones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_384.wav|We regret that they were brought in the first place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_385.wav|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_386.wav|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_387.wav|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_388.wav|He must have seen the movie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_389.wav|We must put a marker down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_390.wav|The result is called a patent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_391.wav|It's as wide as a church in here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_392.wav|This remains the party's policy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_393.wav|The pair are very much in love.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_394.wav|I am a good player.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_395.wav|You have to rely on each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_396.wav|However, it was well worth the wait.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_397.wav|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_398.wav|I wanted to go out on a high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_399.wav|I felt the head was very like me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_400.wav|It was fit for royalty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_401.wav|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_402.wav|We operate as a Scottish company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_403.wav|How do you take them away ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_404.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_405.wav|After the match, do you ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_406.wav|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_407.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_408.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_409.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_410.wav|Motion described it as a unique event.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_411.wav|I had a fortunate war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_412.wav|The breakdown was much later in her life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_413.wav|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_414.wav|It is good for Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_415.wav|It does not even have a staff shortage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_416.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_417.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_418.wav|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_419.wav|But a surprise is in store.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_420.wav|Smoking is also very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_421.wav|The second goal was superb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_422.wav|We're delighted about the vote.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_423.wav|The case will now go to appeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_424.wav|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_425.wav|Yet the data is compelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_426.wav|It was important to win the singles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_427.wav|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_428.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_429.wav|He was on a horse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_430.wav|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_431.wav|That's the way it works.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_432.wav|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_433.wav|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_434.wav|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_435.wav|He is on the wrong side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_436.wav|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_437.wav|It was the climax of the thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_438.wav|The trial will open today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_439.wav|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_440.wav|It will make a huge difference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_441.wav|It is an absolute nonsense.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_442.wav|Everything in golf is a balance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_443.wav|It is a case of pity for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_444.wav|Gordon is also highly rated.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_445.wav|The first game is so important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_446.wav|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_447.wav|And we might go back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_448.wav|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_449.wav|He deserves a second chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_450.wav|You have to see the work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_451.wav|The funding is now there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_452.wav|But we have built a platform for next season.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_453.wav|I was embarrassed by it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_454.wav|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_455.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_457.wav|No one wants to go through these things.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_459.wav|It all began as an accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_460.wav|Long-term, it was the right thing to do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_461.wav|It might be useful to have something in black and white.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_462.wav|They were totally behind it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_463.wav|Let that be their memorial.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_464.wav|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_465.wav|She would take the Farmer to the opera.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_466.wav|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_467.wav|Phil Mickelson did that last year.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_469.wav|They are defined by law.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_470.wav|If that's the case, he will struggle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_471.wav|I'm very pleased for the club and for myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_472.wav|It's been a long, long journey.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_473.wav|War is not the action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p261/p261_474.wav|My place is in the kitchen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_025.wav|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_026.wav|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_027.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_028.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_029.wav|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_030.wav|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_031.wav|I expected these kind of questions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_032.wav|This is the window.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_033.wav|People love to see this stuff.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_034.wav|Life was like a timetable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_035.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_036.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_037.wav|It was clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_038.wav|The problem is the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_039.wav|It was ugly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_040.wav|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_041.wav|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_042.wav|The judge said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_043.wav|It's a crucial award.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_044.wav|It is difficult for Ali.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_045.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_046.wav|I was angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_047.wav|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_048.wav|They had to explain it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_049.wav|He had no enemies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_050.wav|We were surprised to see the photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_051.wav|Next league matches Celtic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_052.wav|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_053.wav|It's very odd.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_054.wav|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_055.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_056.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_057.wav|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_058.wav|Jobs could go.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_059.wav|And a film maker was born.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_060.wav|I fell against him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_061.wav|There was a battle there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_062.wav|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_063.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_064.wav|He was popular.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_065.wav|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_066.wav|It is like a river running by my home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_067.wav|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_068.wav|It's all I can do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_069.wav|He highlighted a lack of staff.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_070.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_071.wav|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_072.wav|I had my suspicions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_073.wav|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_074.wav|I've not thought about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_075.wav|What has changed?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_076.wav|I'd like to continue that record.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_077.wav|Detection is often difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_078.wav|He is driven.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_079.wav|All options are open.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_080.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_081.wav|Someone who cares
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_082.wav|It's never too late.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_083.wav|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_084.wav|That will come after the game on Saturday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_085.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_086.wav|Today I couldn't run on it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_087.wav|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_088.wav|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_089.wav|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_090.wav|Then came the crunch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_091.wav|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_092.wav|They are now divorced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_093.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_094.wav|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_095.wav|FOR once, you should believe the hype.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_096.wav|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_097.wav|It is a good day for the coalition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_098.wav|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_099.wav|Two of the team became ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_100.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_101.wav|It is a good lifestyle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_102.wav|It was an adventure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_103.wav|It's not perfect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_104.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_105.wav|He pleaded for caution.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_106.wav|They are ready.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_107.wav|It's a shame.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_108.wav|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_109.wav|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_110.wav|They were behind the wheel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_111.wav|This film will be totally awesome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_112.wav|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_113.wav|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_114.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_115.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_116.wav|Who would have?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_117.wav|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_118.wav|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_119.wav|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_120.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_121.wav|So the European elections are extremely important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_122.wav|It was the same at Twickenham.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_123.wav|It plans to return to this field.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_124.wav|Our intentions are real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_125.wav|The goals were good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_126.wav|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_127.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_128.wav|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_129.wav|It's a question of fashion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_130.wav|It seems so long since I did the exams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_131.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_132.wav|We need to chat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_133.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_134.wav|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_135.wav|It would be a last resort.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_136.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_137.wav|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_138.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_139.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_140.wav|It is huge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_141.wav|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_142.wav|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_143.wav|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_144.wav|Mr Blair had done well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_145.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_146.wav|We should be clear about the role of government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_147.wav|It is a freedom.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_148.wav|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_149.wav|I knew he was good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_150.wav|They were later discharged from hospital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_151.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_152.wav|Neither side can win this war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_153.wav|He can do no wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_154.wav|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_155.wav|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_156.wav|He's been the key to everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_157.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_158.wav|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_159.wav|As, indeed, they would be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_160.wav|They are not advertised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_161.wav|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_162.wav|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_163.wav|It's that sort of night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_164.wav|It is not too late to get on board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_165.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_166.wav|We have a budget in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_167.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_168.wav|The post will be unpaid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_169.wav|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_170.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_171.wav|We've made a couple of albums.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_172.wav|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_173.wav|Is Saddam a threat?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_174.wav|I feel like my game has come a long way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_175.wav|We wanted it left for a wee while.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_176.wav|The clarity is vital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_177.wav|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_178.wav|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_179.wav|That has been the easy part.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_180.wav|He will need that machine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_181.wav|Nothing is safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_182.wav|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_183.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_184.wav|Miller was every bit as happy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_185.wav|I had a train to catch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_186.wav|That would be my view.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_187.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_188.wav|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_189.wav|We must keep our feet on the ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_190.wav|It wasn't to be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_191.wav|I came home by ambulance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_192.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_193.wav|Our strategy is straightforward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_194.wav|The group is separate from the Real IRA.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_195.wav|People acted too quickly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_196.wav|The service from the other players was super.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_197.wav|He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_198.wav|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_199.wav|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_200.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_201.wav|They are in the euro.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_202.wav|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_203.wav|It's all about money, money, money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_204.wav|There was no rescue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_205.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_206.wav|But I am a worried man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_207.wav|There was an e-mail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_208.wav|It's a big deal for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_209.wav|We'll have to work hard today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_210.wav|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_211.wav|I had decided to quit the show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_212.wav|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_213.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_214.wav|He seemed to lose his focus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_215.wav|Work has started.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_216.wav|His death was a tragic accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_217.wav|But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_218.wav|IT S the real thing, for sure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_219.wav|We have not given up hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_220.wav|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_221.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_222.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_223.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_224.wav|The track is currently covered in snow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_225.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_226.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_227.wav|The Dow Jones is way up.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_228.wav|However, no further action was taken by police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_229.wav|It's that kind of place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_230.wav|But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_231.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_232.wav|It's very safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_233.wav|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_234.wav|It is a terrible loss.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_235.wav|But it's a subtle process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_236.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_237.wav|Of further privacy, he had no need.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_238.wav|He was good, but not that good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_239.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_240.wav|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_241.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_242.wav|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_243.wav|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_244.wav|They may yet have the last laugh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_245.wav|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_246.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_247.wav|The scene is about this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_248.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_249.wav|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_250.wav|I was shocked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_251.wav|A friendship that will endure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_252.wav|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_253.wav|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_254.wav|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_255.wav|That could be in place by next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_256.wav|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_257.wav|We run within the law.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_258.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_259.wav|This is a big club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_260.wav|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_261.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_262.wav|I am very angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_263.wav|I saw one body.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_264.wav|At first I thought I was gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_265.wav|They wanted the club to make money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_266.wav|We shall rely on human beings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_267.wav|Immediate action must be taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_268.wav|It's very nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_269.wav|He was also married with two children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_270.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_271.wav|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_272.wav|It's not even finished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_273.wav|Things can change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_274.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_275.wav|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_276.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_277.wav|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_278.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_279.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_280.wav|We have to break that cycle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_281.wav|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_282.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_283.wav|I saw it at a ruck.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_284.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_285.wav|He will address the nation this evening.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_286.wav|The attacker died in the crash.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_287.wav|It was a virus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_288.wav|The mood is good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_289.wav|This is a national crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_290.wav|The death toll included five children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_291.wav|Who did the recruiting?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_292.wav|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_293.wav|It's a lovely, lovely film.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_294.wav|Well, he can do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_295.wav|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_296.wav|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_297.wav|And huge, indeed, it is.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_298.wav|The results are sometimes contentious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_299.wav|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_300.wav|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_301.wav|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_302.wav|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_303.wav|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_304.wav|What has altered?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_305.wav|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_306.wav|One was a lawyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_307.wav|However, the groups denied the claims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_308.wav|They should be swept away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_309.wav|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_310.wav|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_311.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_312.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_313.wav|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_314.wav|The letters are going out today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_315.wav|We want to play at the worlds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_316.wav|Is there on his hands?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_317.wav|Special measures were needed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_318.wav|It's about my time as a guitarist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_319.wav|I never thought it would take this long.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_320.wav|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_321.wav|We are a peaceful people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_322.wav|It should be equal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_323.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_324.wav|The problems began a long time ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_325.wav|My body is clearly capable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_326.wav|He said she was mad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_327.wav|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_328.wav|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_329.wav|We are in the end game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_330.wav|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_331.wav|The parents will have a great time, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_332.wav|I am so upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_333.wav|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_334.wav|It could have gone either way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_335.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_336.wav|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_337.wav|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_338.wav|The team for the first game could be this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_339.wav|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_340.wav|The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_341.wav|His views are hardly surprising.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_342.wav|I would miss him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_343.wav|It will be very, very tight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_344.wav|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_345.wav|It was forced to divert.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_346.wav|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_347.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_348.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_349.wav|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_350.wav|I got a yellow card.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_351.wav|There is no link.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_352.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_353.wav|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_354.wav|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_355.wav|A man has since been charged with his murder.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_356.wav|It is horrible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_357.wav|The council said the house would have to be demolished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_358.wav|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_359.wav|He's very explosive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_360.wav|It was one in the afternoon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_361.wav|We will be homeless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_362.wav|That would help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_363.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_364.wav|It was a double tragedy for the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_365.wav|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_366.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_367.wav|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_368.wav|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_369.wav|Talks are progressing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_370.wav|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_371.wav|It was a funny game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_372.wav|It is a large number.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_373.wav|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_374.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_375.wav|I am a wealthy person.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_376.wav|Something is wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_377.wav|Mentally, you have to be tough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_378.wav|I am very happy with life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_379.wav|I was so nervous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_380.wav|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_381.wav|However, it's good to turn the page.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_382.wav|It would be a massive boost for them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_383.wav|The release attracted little attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_384.wav|It was important to win the singles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_385.wav|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_386.wav|We're looking for justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_387.wav|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_388.wav|They are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_389.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_390.wav|It was on fire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_391.wav|This is a major step forward for carers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_392.wav|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_393.wav|Emotions were complex.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p262/p262_394.wav|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_025.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_026.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_027.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_028.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_029.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_030.wav|We would like to find another region to develop in England.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_031.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_032.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_033.wav|Allan Johnston was not match fit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_034.wav|The idea is not new.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_035.wav|I could not do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_036.wav|Life was like a timetable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_037.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_038.wav|You have to expect this type of thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_039.wav|No company would want to put their people at risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_040.wav|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_041.wav|It could well be the case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_042.wav|This work on a marketing strategy would be finished within two months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_043.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_044.wav|It will come all right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_045.wav|It seemed the tough times were behind him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_046.wav|That company should not be allowed to operate in this country.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_047.wav|The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_048.wav|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_049.wav|I didn't think any player was a success on Saturday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_050.wav|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_051.wav|I would love to have him home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_052.wav|He looks like an Afghan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_053.wav|He will need that machine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_054.wav|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_055.wav|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_056.wav|We have not given up hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_057.wav|It will now take over the running of the estate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_058.wav|I've got to provide for my family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_059.wav|It was bound to happen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_060.wav|Four other charges were dropped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_061.wav|We have to keep our clients.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_062.wav|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_063.wav|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_064.wav|I am pleased to be in them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_065.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_066.wav|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_067.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_068.wav|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_069.wav|It is the only way forward for the club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_070.wav|I was very pleased with them today, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_071.wav|It's all I can do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_072.wav|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_073.wav|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_074.wav|It is a job creation scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_075.wav|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_076.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_077.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_078.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_079.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_080.wav|And does it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_081.wav|Are you from the rugby ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_082.wav|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_083.wav|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_084.wav|The insurance company is only interested in your profits.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_085.wav|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_086.wav|Thomson is expected to manage the business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_087.wav|The damage from the fire was huge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_088.wav|A play is a set of actions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_089.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_090.wav|Scottish rugby has been in a state of civil war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_091.wav|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_092.wav|The first few days will determine whether she can survive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_093.wav|The trick is to try it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_094.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_095.wav|It might change your life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_096.wav|No-one in the passenger train was hurt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_097.wav|Mr Blair should be warned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_098.wav|You might not make it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_099.wav|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_100.wav|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_101.wav|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_102.wav|I did not have a bet on myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_103.wav|I saw the whole thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_104.wav|A progress report will be published in October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_105.wav|The investment will be in the food.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_106.wav|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_107.wav|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_108.wav|Our preference is to play in midweek.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_109.wav|You are like an animal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_110.wav|In the end we made too many errors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_111.wav|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_112.wav|That all hope is never lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_113.wav|It should be a great game, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_114.wav|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_115.wav|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_116.wav|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_117.wav|He was jailed for a year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_118.wav|It was won on the issue of the land.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_119.wav|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_120.wav|The fire was above the hole.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_121.wav|Pupils will be the losers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_122.wav|The problem was a social problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_123.wav|Such actions are rarely popular.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_124.wav|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_125.wav|It isn't a happy memory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_126.wav|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_127.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_128.wav|They've got to account for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_129.wav|It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_130.wav|It would be great to reward the Scottish public with a win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_131.wav|You can spend money on housing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_132.wav|I told him I was a long time ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_133.wav|They have to come clean.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_134.wav|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_135.wav|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_136.wav|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_137.wav|It is just a tax on employment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_138.wav|The move has provoked a mixed response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_139.wav|The squad is too small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_140.wav|Why change it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_141.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_142.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_143.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_144.wav|The temperature in the town is very difficult to control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_145.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_146.wav|Any success would have been an improvement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_147.wav|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_148.wav|I never wanted a legal battle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_149.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_150.wav|Next time round, it will be different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_151.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_152.wav|We have seen a copy of the report.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_153.wav|But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_154.wav|It is the quality of the work that counts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_155.wav|Check that he is dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_156.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_157.wav|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_158.wav|There is no mandate for a regime change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_159.wav|Like the others, he was arrested.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_160.wav|She will do for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_161.wav|I have had a good life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_162.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_163.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_164.wav|It is crucial for both teams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_165.wav|However, she did not report the matter to the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_166.wav|Nobody in Scotland has recognised the creative talent involved in this area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_167.wav|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_168.wav|The other businesses were based in Yorkshire and Northern Ireland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_169.wav|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_170.wav|Neither side can win this war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_171.wav|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_172.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_173.wav|It is an attitude of mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_174.wav|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_175.wav|Eight months later, he was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_176.wav|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_177.wav|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_178.wav|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_179.wav|So was the first half.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_180.wav|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_181.wav|The decision was blamed on weak investment markets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_182.wav|It's nice to be involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_183.wav|Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_184.wav|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_185.wav|Waiting times for these services are too long.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_186.wav|Time is now very short.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_187.wav|Our position remains the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_188.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_189.wav|The region is open for business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_190.wav|I feel like my game has come a long way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_191.wav|The championship is different from the other majors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_192.wav|It makes no influence on the public.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_193.wav|I thought he did very well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_194.wav|Says the Duke of York.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_195.wav|The shooting created panic in the street.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_196.wav|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_197.wav|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_198.wav|You know the sort of thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_199.wav|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_200.wav|We are committed to realising the potential of every child.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_201.wav|It is a terrible loss.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_202.wav|I think, therefore I am ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_203.wav|Who was she ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_204.wav|Or was it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_205.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_206.wav|Two years later, she was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_207.wav|It is not easy to live in Russia.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_208.wav|It is difficult to comment on the prospects for the year ahead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_209.wav|However, this idea is never developed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_210.wav|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_211.wav|We must keep our feet on the ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_212.wav|It is hard to tell.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_213.wav|He should emerge as the winner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_214.wav|I came home by ambulance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_215.wav|This decision was taken with the full support of Scottish ministers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_216.wav|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_217.wav|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_218.wav|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_219.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_220.wav|They are in the euro.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_221.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_222.wav|The defender should have won the bloody ba.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_223.wav|A deadline is still essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_224.wav|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_225.wav|Bombing is the easy option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_226.wav|He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_227.wav|Abbey National is an option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_228.wav|We can hardly talk about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_229.wav|It was located on the remote control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_230.wav|It is safe in our hands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_231.wav|I'm just a regular person.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_232.wav|I am considered a teenager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_233.wav|In each case they were a goal down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_234.wav|It's just a normal life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_235.wav|He remains a main board director of Royal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_236.wav|People should make their own decisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_237.wav|That you can do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_238.wav|We will reform the welfare state.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_239.wav|It could be to do with the location.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_241.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_242.wav|She will attend in July.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_243.wav|The body follows the mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_244.wav|I always felt that I was in control of the match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_245.wav|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_246.wav|That will be the criteria for the future.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_247.wav|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_248.wav|We were a load of rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_249.wav|He has run a hell of a race.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_250.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_251.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_252.wav|Is it in the right place ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_253.wav|Did he trip ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_254.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_255.wav|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_256.wav|The deal is expected to be completed by next summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_257.wav|The irony was not lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_258.wav|Three weeks later, he resigned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_259.wav|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_260.wav|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_261.wav|You look like a rugby player.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_262.wav|Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_263.wav|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_264.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_265.wav|You can feel at home in China.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_266.wav|We've got a lot of that sort of nonsense in the North-east.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_267.wav|The whole point is to get the issue into the open.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_268.wav|My son was too young to die.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_269.wav|It should have taken a year for a company this size.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_270.wav|We were not allowed to go to help them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_271.wav|I didn't see the point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_272.wav|It seems a shame to leave it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_273.wav|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_274.wav|I can't get a job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_275.wav|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_276.wav|That could be in place by next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_277.wav|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_278.wav|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_279.wav|They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_280.wav|They must play for each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_281.wav|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_282.wav|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_283.wav|They can leave at any time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_284.wav|I was delighted with the way he jumped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_285.wav|Much of the equipment was new.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_286.wav|You get a lot for your money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_287.wav|An announcement will follow in due course.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_288.wav|He has not created a Festival resource.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_289.wav|He was also married with two children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_291.wav|I was first in the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_292.wav|Access has been a nightmare.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_293.wav|Further expansion has been achieved in Germany and Italy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_294.wav|It will always be the highlight of my career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_295.wav|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_296.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_297.wav|She failed in her action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_298.wav|Its body language is all wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_299.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_300.wav|The record companies have gone through the floor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_301.wav|So the Government will be damaged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_302.wav|I have lost all confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_303.wav|John was there already in spirit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_304.wav|In the end, it was no choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_305.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_306.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_307.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_308.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_309.wav|I intended to look for another club on loan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_310.wav|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_311.wav|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_312.wav|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_313.wav|I have decided to stand down from the list.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_314.wav|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_315.wav|They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_316.wav|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_317.wav|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_318.wav|Nothing has been put into action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_319.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_320.wav|Like many companies, it is a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_321.wav|Action must be taken to slow down the traffic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_322.wav|However, a bid was never made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_323.wav|We're not an employment agency.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_324.wav|I could not have hoped to run at this level.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_325.wav|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_326.wav|The following year was a miserable time for Mr Dewar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_327.wav|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_328.wav|They come to enjoy themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_329.wav|There's still a bit to go.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_330.wav|We have a good healthy debate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_331.wav|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_332.wav|It is a court case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_333.wav|The minister is the engineer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_334.wav|There is no plan B.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_335.wav|He will go a long way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_336.wav|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_337.wav|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_338.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_339.wav|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_340.wav|She is on a life support machine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_341.wav|He is married with three children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_342.wav|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_343.wav|It's difficult to predict the future.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_344.wav|My body is clearly capable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_345.wav|Tourists are only concerned with the quality of their experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_346.wav|In the old days, it was easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_347.wav|The airport was even different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_348.wav|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_349.wav|It is the same old story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_350.wav|Analysts were not surprised at the talks between the companies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_351.wav|Overall, we are very pleased.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_352.wav|It was tough to contain the excitement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_353.wav|Does it matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_354.wav|How do you take them away ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_355.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_356.wav|After the match, do you ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_357.wav|The pain was almost too much to bear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_358.wav|Whether this return was too soon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_359.wav|There is a good example in this city.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_360.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_361.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_362.wav|That's as it should be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_363.wav|The key player in this matter is now the Prime Minister.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_364.wav|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_365.wav|There is a range of employers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_366.wav|But we welcome this document.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_367.wav|He did a good job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_368.wav|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_369.wav|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_370.wav|The value of the merger is still there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_371.wav|Nobody else was with me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_372.wav|She would take the Farmer to the opera.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_373.wav|They may yet have the last laugh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_374.wav|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_375.wav|And I repeat, it would be for exposure and money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_376.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_377.wav|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_378.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_379.wav|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_380.wav|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_381.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_382.wav|They were to blame for the first two goals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_383.wav|The bank was now involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_384.wav|It was like a weekly wage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_385.wav|Scottish teams have got to take their chances.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_386.wav|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_387.wav|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_388.wav|You have to rely on each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_389.wav|This season has been a nightmare.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_390.wav|I felt the head was very like me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_391.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_392.wav|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_393.wav|She has a little boy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_394.wav|Theatre is not a museum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_395.wav|I was just happy to get my own goal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_396.wav|He later became a respected High Court judge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_397.wav|The thing is to recognise that chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_398.wav|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_399.wav|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_400.wav|They have put in a lot of time and effort.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_401.wav|He's in his element and the audience is delighted by him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_402.wav|He replied that it was a dilemma.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_403.wav|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_404.wav|He said the Parliament should be left to make its own decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_405.wav|MAN is fully listed on the London Stock Exchange.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_406.wav|We must improve our relations with government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_407.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_408.wav|It was an amazing afternoon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_409.wav|The casualties were not named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_410.wav|We shall not be moved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_411.wav|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_412.wav|It looked like a river.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_413.wav|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_414.wav|Once again, they were back amongst the big boys.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_415.wav|It was important to win the singles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_416.wav|I'm pleased about one thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_417.wav|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_418.wav|I had a tie in my hand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_419.wav|I can lead by example.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_420.wav|Such an attack is bizarre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_421.wav|Today, the story is different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_422.wav|The Queen Mother is dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_423.wav|Head injuries are the leading cause of death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_424.wav|We have received a number of inquiries from interested parties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_425.wav|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_426.wav|A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_427.wav|But we are severely limited in funds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_428.wav|Together, we can make a difference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_429.wav|It is that sort of film.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_430.wav|Mr Reid said the repeal was a sensitive issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_431.wav|They recorded their debut album in New York.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_432.wav|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_433.wav|Which may be the same thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_434.wav|It is not a standing army.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_435.wav|We know about the crisis in cattle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_436.wav|As it turned out it was a triumph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_437.wav|We shall not forget him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_438.wav|I can't wait for the season to end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_439.wav|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_440.wav|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_441.wav|You have got to be careful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_442.wav|There is The Beautiful Game to write.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_443.wav|No decisions have been made in this respect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_444.wav|It wouldn't matter if he had.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_445.wav|No, because it was too many.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_446.wav|He deserves a second chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_447.wav|I believed that effort was needed in our own area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_448.wav|It is not over by any means.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_449.wav|The second goal was a terrible mistake by our defence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_450.wav|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_451.wav|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_452.wav|But we have built a platform for next season.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_453.wav|It looked like a war zone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_454.wav|Legal opinion is that I may have a case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_455.wav|However, one has arrived in the post.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_456.wav|They offer a kind of narrative.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_457.wav|He looked on the deal as a merger rather than a takeover.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_458.wav|He doesn't like the Labour Party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_459.wav|It goes with the job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_460.wav|It has been a waste of time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_461.wav|The rest of the business is very robust.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_462.wav|I saw it didn't work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_463.wav|To tell the truth, it wasn't a good game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_464.wav|We are over the moon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_465.wav|It was another reminder of the power of an image.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_466.wav|They're just a good retailer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_467.wav|Tickets will be at a premium.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_468.wav|It's been a long, long journey.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_469.wav|I just got under the ball a bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_470.wav|There is a similar story for milk and dairy products.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_471.wav|That should get their attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_472.wav|It's just a place to open it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p263/p263_473.wav|My place is in the kitchen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_001.wav|Please call Stella.  )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  )

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_026.wav|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_027.wav|He does not even trust his own members.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_028.wav|We're only taking on a couple just now.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_029.wav|The local primary is excellent.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_030.wav|Do not give your details to anyone.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_031.wav|I feel I did not have enough time.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_032.wav|He added that her comments were noted.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_033.wav|It felt right for me.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_034.wav|We are opening an inquiry.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_035.wav|This remains the case.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_036.wav|Certainly, we do as well.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_037.wav|It carried a double message.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_038.wav|It was a total surprise.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_039.wav|I wish I could see it again.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_040.wav|I am secure in my owns position.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_041.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_042.wav|It is a complex deal.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_043.wav|I made my mind up before we came on tour.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_044.wav|It does not stop here.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_045.wav|We're working on it night and day.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_046.wav|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_048.wav|There remains some Scottish influence, however.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_049.wav|I only signed this morning.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_050.wav|The Office is a show about nothing, then.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_051.wav|We were leading by two goals.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_053.wav|It was dangerous but vital employment.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_054.wav|All options are available.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_055.wav|How are you, sir?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_056.wav|So is that it, then?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_057.wav|Do I have a favourite?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_058.wav|What do we do?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_059.wav|Why do it otherwise?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_060.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_061.wav|So, did she meet him?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_062.wav|It happens from time to time.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_063.wav|You could very well be.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_064.wav|People come to see the Highlands.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_065.wav|It is nice to be a woman and a wife.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_066.wav|She always put the party first.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_067.wav|Things have just worked out this way.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_068.wav|That is not possible.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_069.wav|This is far too high.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_070.wav|He has real potential.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_071.wav|But I had never been in a theatre.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_072.wav|Without doubt, the debate on education is welcome.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_073.wav|Confidence is as low as it can get.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_074.wav|I think with my experience I can help the team.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_075.wav|That is really all.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_076.wav|The deal was done on Wednesday.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_077.wav|The time has arrived for a review.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_078.wav|That is very important.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_079.wav|Only water is currently allowed.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_080.wav|Put simply, it goes something like this.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_081.wav|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_082.wav|It looks that way.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_083.wav|Now comes the hard part.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_084.wav|Maybe they will see sense.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_085.wav|We're at home, which is important.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_086.wav|Because I was a very physical person.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_087.wav|The circumstances have changed since last year.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_088.wav|They're already booked for next year.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_089.wav|The savings can be dramatic.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_090.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_091.wav|They are a different team at home.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_092.wav|However this weekend it will be different.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_093.wav|Are you going to win?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_094.wav|What is the wife?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_096.wav|What do we want to do that for?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_097.wav|Does the name matter?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_098.wav|how do you get it back?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_099.wav|What are you not good at?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_100.wav|His massive advantage was never under threat yesterday.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_101.wav|Two of our crew were killed.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_102.wav|I feel confident about the outcome.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_103.wav|The referee had been right.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_104.wav|Jack was always going to win this one.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_105.wav|It would be easy to think so.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_106.wav|You're quite wrong, he said.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_107.wav|I was born for this moment.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_108.wav|I first met him last summer.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_109.wav|The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_110.wav|You can maintain regular contact.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_112.wav|This makes up for it.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_113.wav|Firm action must be taken.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_114.wav|But they had to be paid for.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_115.wav|That's the bit that's wrong.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_116.wav|Nothing would now surprise me.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_117.wav|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_118.wav|But I am in practice.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_119.wav|Trading is tough at the moment.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_120.wav|It came a bit late.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_121.wav|All music goes into me.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_122.wav|That was a great performance by the team.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_123.wav|It seemed like four hours.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_124.wav|The family moved around a lot.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_125.wav|We beat the Welsh team.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_126.wav|An announcement is expected within a few months.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_127.wav|We have a team to reach the final.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_128.wav|Eight others have followed.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_129.wav|These people were my friends.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_130.wav|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_131.wav|It's nice to see a very positive style of football.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_132.wav|This commitment should be built upon.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_133.wav|I hope we've reached the bottom now.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_134.wav|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_135.wav|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_136.wav|However, it's possible that Dick can have influence some Dutch players to go there.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_137.wav|This is a separate announcement which is in a different league.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_138.wav|It's very dangerous for markets.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_139.wav|He said some things which were better left alone.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_140.wav|He nearly killed my son.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_141.wav|That comes at a cost.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_142.wav|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_143.wav|I told them during their morning break.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_144.wav|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_145.wav|The truth will come out.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_146.wav|Mr Dewar understood that.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_147.wav|She's been shot.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_148.wav|Do I think about them often?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_149.wav|Is it in the right place?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_150.wav|Did he trip?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_151.wav|Does that put pressure on us?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_152.wav|Did it work?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_153.wav|Their moment had come, or so they said.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_154.wav|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_155.wav|The second failed completely.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_156.wav|It gives a commitment.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_157.wav|Now it was Britain's turn.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_158.wav|We have come a long way since then.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_159.wav|Sport is good for you.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_160.wav|It was clearly not a battle.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_161.wav|No such meeting took place.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_162.wav|It is just too tough.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_163.wav|There is no doubt there's room for us.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_164.wav|The options seem limited.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_165.wav|It's been my life.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_166.wav|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_167.wav|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_168.wav|Everything people said about it was true.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_169.wav|I've no idea how it works.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_170.wav|No, but my wife is.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_171.wav|It is a large number.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_172.wav|I'm taking each day as it comes.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_173.wav|Art can challenge our value system.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_174.wav|Now he's back on top again.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_176.wav|No-one wants to talk about death.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_177.wav|Once again, he refused.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_178.wav|We just want this session to end.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_179.wav|You can spend money on housing.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_180.wav|I've never had a year like this.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_181.wav|Neil has worked hard throughout his career.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_182.wav|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_183.wav|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_184.wav|She really suffered for her art.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_185.wav|The single currency could well lead to a single tax policy.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_186.wav|She runs like her mother.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_187.wav|I remember that day well.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_188.wav|In short, the national team without Frank is like football without feet.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_189.wav|They were certainly tough, but totally fair.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_190.wav|The questions came quick and fast.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_191.wav|We tried four banks.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_192.wav|Is there a waiting list?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_193.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_194.wav|So what happens next?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_195.wav|Had this been common practice?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_196.wav|What do they want us to do?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_197.wav|Is it worth it?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_198.wav|Does it matter?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_199.wav|How do you take them away?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_200.wav|At half-time he was presented to both teams.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_201.wav|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_202.wav|I was independent but I am not now.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_203.wav|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_204.wav|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_205.wav|I saw people on fire.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_206.wav|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_207.wav|Both leaders were joined by senior party figures.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_208.wav|Her experience is certainly limited.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_211.wav|He was a home referee.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_213.wav|It was men against boys.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_214.wav|Three hit the target.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_215.wav|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_216.wav|Henry should go now.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_217.wav|Now we have fresh hope.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_218.wav|Life is still very tough for them.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_219.wav|It was a piece of art.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_221.wav|Britain will be little affected.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_222.wav|The two companies were not for sale.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_223.wav|IT has been a tough year for Scottish business.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_224.wav|It was all great training.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_226.wav|No partners would lose their jobs.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_227.wav|I was in daily contact.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_228.wav|He talks too much.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_230.wav|Many changes are positive changes.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_231.wav|This is absolutely not true.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_232.wav|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_233.wav|It was a great evening.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_234.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_235.wav|After the match, do you?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_236.wav|Has the conflict started?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_237.wav|Have I really come to this?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_238.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_240.wav|This is a big game for both of us.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_241.wav|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_242.wav|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_243.wav|Eight months later, he was dead.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_244.wav|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_245.wav|I go home only once.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_246.wav|It is based on population rather than need.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_247.wav|Progress, however, is only achieved through hard work and heavy investment.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_248.wav|They were game, but not very good.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_249.wav|I did not vote either way.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_250.wav|We really are a team.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_251.wav|I hit you there.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_252.wav|The pension levels will remain the same.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_253.wav|He is keen to stay in public service.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_254.wav|For that reason cover should not be given.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_255.wav|He felt too close to head office.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_256.wav|We have brought the staff back on board.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_257.wav|We had a right to expect those days were over.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_258.wav|The group's increasing scale will help.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_259.wav|We were looking for a base.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_260.wav|We had a grand view.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_261.wav|Walker declined to put a figure on losses.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_262.wav|They made such decisions in London.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_263.wav|The proposal was rejected.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_264.wav|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_265.wav|Some changes have been achieved at great cost.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_266.wav|Everyone wanted him to win.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_267.wav|I was totally wrong.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_268.wav|I may play with two players up, maybe not.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_269.wav|Others get through it.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_270.wav|I knew him well.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_271.wav|I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_272.wav|All films open tomorrow)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_273.wav|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_274.wav|The third has yet to be named.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_275.wav|He was called in by the government last year to report on pension reform.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_276.wav|Scots police had been asked to join the search to find him.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_277.wav|People realise we have a job to do.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_278.wav|I'm interested in interesting work.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_279.wav|It would be nice to be involved in another victory.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_280.wav|Sales will begin by the end of October.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_281.wav|He will get his chances.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_282.wav|Friday night was a pretty good night.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_283.wav|She now lives in London.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_284.wav|It's not a small step.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_285.wav|They have the cash and the fire power.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_286.wav|The institute board will take the decision.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_287.wav|He followed the Italian route.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_288.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_289.wav|You have made your point.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_290.wav|He died the following year.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_291.wav|We must move on.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_292.wav|It's just an area of water.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_293.wav|Rangers was on the agenda and I am interested.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_294.wav|If so, we want to hear from them.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_295.wav|She doesn't know the half of it.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_296.wav|Perhaps they were right.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_297.wav|Autumn will be a real challenge.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_298.wav|Many events are down on numbers.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_299.wav|He had served his time.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_300.wav|That was around July, August.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_301.wav|The direct effects on trade will be limited.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_302.wav|It changed the very language.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_303.wav|It was finally agreed on Saturday.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_304.wav|I did so, making the positive case for Scottish New Labour.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_305.wav|Only one got through.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_306.wav|He remains a main board director of Royal.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_307.wav|It's not a marketing scheme.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_308.wav|There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_309.wav|Five years ago its return was rejected.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_310.wav|He left pretty quickly.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_311.wav|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_312.wav|They might surprise themselves.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_313.wav|It is his speed off the mark that is so impressive.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_314.wav|Hibs are playing with style now.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_315.wav|Such a policy is for long-term strength.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_316.wav|This is extremely positive news.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_317.wav|Other teams moved up too.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_318.wav|I just felt like a dead loss.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_319.wav|Not one person spoke badly.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_320.wav|The performance continues to improve.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_321.wav|We want immediate action.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_322.wav|Our relationship has been very good.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_323.wav|Someone should tell them.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_324.wav|They really had a go at us.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_325.wav|They should try to get tickets.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_326.wav|The change could come as soon as September.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_327.wav|They emerged before the patients left hospital.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_328.wav|He did not say that.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_329.wav|We are a husband and wife team.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_330.wav|I can't get away from it.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_331.wav|He had played very well.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_332.wav|Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_333.wav|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_334.wav|I saw one man vote five times.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_335.wav|It's quite crucial for me.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_336.wav|This fact is supported by audience research.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_337.wav|The regional government faces key elections next May.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_339.wav|Time remains to put other candidates forward.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_340.wav|In Great Britain, it has a life of its own.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_341.wav|This deal is a great boost for the Borders.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_342.wav|An opera company needs to have its orchestra.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_343.wav|The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_344.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_345.wav|I believe they are dead.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_346.wav|We have no information on Iraq.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_347.wav|We had to approach it the way we feel we can do best.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_348.wav|It looks at public interest issues.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_349.wav|The book is closed.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_350.wav|I would be very keen on a move to Italy.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_351.wav|He is fully fit.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_352.wav|That would concern me lot.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_353.wav|It's clearly a budget.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_354.wav|Both watched her win yesterday.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_355.wav|Her father had died recently.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_356.wav|We accept the new rules.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_357.wav|Neil knows the score.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_358.wav|He could still be President.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_371.wav|Without rules, the elections could not go ahead, he stressed.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_372.wav|I took my chance.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_376.wav|He was always Scottish Labour, or simply Labour.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_377.wav|It would have to look for outside funding.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_378.wav|John gave up everything to be with me.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_379.wav|He had wanted to play, but we had to be responsible about the decision we took.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_380.wav|I have been going through a lot of things.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_381.wav|People could have a post box in the local post office.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_382.wav|If we get a penalty next week I want to take it.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_383.wav|This is too much like Scotland.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_385.wav|His third child was born in April.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_386.wav|They want the style of the sound changed a bit.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_387.wav|Young people will always run away.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_388.wav|The view is impressive.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_389.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_390.wav|It is the same with Barry.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_391.wav|The experts got it wrong.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_392.wav|We have done our own tests.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_393.wav|No, because they look good boys.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_394.wav|His deal is effective for two years, starting in July.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_395.wav|We learned two things.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_396.wav|It has been only average.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_397.wav|It was either Wednesday or Thursday, he said.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_398.wav|It was an attitude thing.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_399.wav|But it is her picture.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_400.wav|The tickets are on their way.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_401.wav|He plays only for himself.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_402.wav|They have quick front players, but so do we.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_403.wav|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_404.wav|It was that kind of match.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_405.wav|Good records have always been recognised by successful farmers.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_406.wav|The songs are just so good.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_407.wav|So I moved on.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_408.wav|That view was confirmed by Welsh coach Graham Henry.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_409.wav|You took the law into your own hands.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_410.wav|But British scientists were not convinced by the findings.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_411.wav|They like big name players.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_412.wav|Financial services also saw a sharp reduction in new business.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_413.wav|Williams said the same.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_414.wav|I was the sheep.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_415.wav|I've learned a huge amount from Michael.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_416.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_417.wav|A report will be issued by March.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_418.wav|The legislation is expected to be introduced next spring.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_419.wav|We didn't really have to power up.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_420.wav|He is very fast all right.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_421.wav|They could change them tomorrow.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_422.wav|We have some options there.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_423.wav|This man must be helped to keep his arm.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_424.wav|Our performance wasn't perfect.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_425.wav|Those overseas offices were great.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_426.wav|She had black eyes.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_427.wav|In practice, the economic tests have to be met.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_428.wav|I have to protect them.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_429.wav|The people are nice, though.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_430.wav|Equipment is also a problem.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_431.wav|We cannot ask for them back.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_432.wav|The tie isn't over.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_433.wav|He doesn't need to hit people.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_434.wav|A job is a job, after all.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_435.wav|It all came good.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_436.wav|It was a hard fight.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_437.wav|Special measures were needed.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_438.wav|However, the proposal is not aimed at rugby, but at all sports.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_439.wav|Colin Cameron was excellent.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_440.wav|That approach has passed its sell by date.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_441.wav|Sir George said every company in the country has this issue at the moment.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_442.wav|WE all watch the same match.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_443.wav|We would deal first with the biggest party.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_444.wav|The company was set up six years ago.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_445.wav|It was an outstanding performance.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_446.wav|The three previous winners also came from Scotland.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_447.wav|In the old days, it was easy.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_448.wav|Powers looks straight ahead.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_449.wav|The festival runs until Tuesday.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_450.wav|We are unable to provide support for future issues.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_451.wav|These days are past.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_452.wav|The official also said no groups had made any terrorist claims involving the crash.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_453.wav|They finished second and third.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_454.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_455.wav|They thought he was asking the right questions.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_456.wav|It had been accepted.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_457.wav|The truth was rather different.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_458.wav|The technology looks excellent.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_459.wav|The party had high hopes of taking the seat from Labour.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_460.wav|We have very limited capacity.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_461.wav|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_462.wav|They're interested only in profits.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_463.wav|That does not take much training.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_464.wav|Scotland needs this award.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_465.wav|He enjoyed being with his family.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_466.wav|It's a strategy which would work beyond this show.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_467.wav|This is a big advantage.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_468.wav|He dismissed the action.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_469.wav|If they gave me free electricity I still wouldn't support the plans.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_470.wav|It is an industry failure.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_471.wav|Each year they cut them down a bit.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_472.wav|We showed some spirit against Newcastle.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_473.wav|It's a tough old job to get for your first job.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_474.wav|I've got to win here to be happy.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_475.wav|I'm delighted for Andy.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_476.wav|Tell us about it.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_477.wav|The child has denied murder.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_478.wav|The union has threatened strike action unless these demands are met.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_479.wav|We were given a break.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_480.wav|The first four teams were all inside the previous record.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_481.wav|The parties include the Scottish Executive.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_482.wav|I'd like my TV programmes to be simple, but not too simple.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_483.wav|Your bank may offer you a choice of options.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_484.wav|That is surely worth a try.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_485.wav|I believe in theatre.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_486.wav|The accident seemed so simple.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_487.wav|Her father wasn't best pleased.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_488.wav|Just look at his fashion sense.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_489.wav|That time may never be broken.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_490.wav|We've got good options.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_491.wav|This operation will change her life.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_492.wav|New York is my home.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_493.wav|He added that trading data for the new stores would be revealed in due course.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_494.wav|That means a ban on French products.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p264/p264_495.wav|This is yet another example of double standards from headquarters.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_025.wav|Is this accurate?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_026.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_027.wav|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_028.wav|This is the window.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_029.wav|We speak about the performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_030.wav|It's a fact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_031.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_032.wav|It has failed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_033.wav|It was clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_034.wav|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_035.wav|Indeed, he does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_036.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_037.wav|Dancing was her life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_038.wav|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_039.wav|It's the only thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_040.wav|This represents a tough game for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_041.wav|A neighbour said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_042.wav|Among them are many criminals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_043.wav|She looked so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_044.wav|This is a club on the rise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_045.wav|I guess I was lucky, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_046.wav|There was no safety net.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_047.wav|It is unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_048.wav|I expect a rapid response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_049.wav|TODAY it begins.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_050.wav|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_051.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_052.wav|It's that kind of place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_053.wav|They are real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_054.wav|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_055.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_056.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_057.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_058.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_059.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_060.wav|The tournament has now been cancelled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_061.wav|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_063.wav|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_064.wav|Neither it is.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_065.wav|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_066.wav|Is there a new way forward?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_067.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_068.wav|The results are tragic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_069.wav|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_070.wav|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_071.wav|What has changed?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_072.wav|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_073.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_074.wav|A play is a set of actions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_075.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_076.wav|By then, he was walking on water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_077.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_078.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_079.wav|It will be tight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_080.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_081.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_082.wav|It is a lifeline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_083.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_084.wav|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_085.wav|This one did.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_086.wav|They are now divorced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_087.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_088.wav|I saw the whole thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_089.wav|It was mayhem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_090.wav|Journalists should make him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_091.wav|It is a love affair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_092.wav|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_093.wav|May not have been at fault?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_094.wav|They tried to deny it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_095.wav|We have an election in eight days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_096.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_097.wav|He takes the job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_098.wav|She reflects a bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_099.wav|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_100.wav|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_101.wav|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_102.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_103.wav|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_104.wav|It's a shame.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_105.wav|It was the eighties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_106.wav|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_107.wav|You had better believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_108.wav|It is rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_109.wav|Who would be a referee?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_110.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_111.wav|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_112.wav|That's all right then.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_113.wav|I'm so angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_114.wav|Holland won by five wickets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_115.wav|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_116.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_117.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_118.wav|It plans to return to this field.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_119.wav|They took a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_120.wav|We work well together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_121.wav|What will happen then?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_122.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_123.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_124.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_125.wav|Is that it?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_126.wav|It is a time bomb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_127.wav|I was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_128.wav|I don't know the full story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_129.wav|It seems so long since I did the exams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_130.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_131.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_132.wav|He realises his mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_133.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_134.wav|The idea is simple.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_135.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_136.wav|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_137.wav|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_138.wav|You know the type.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_139.wav|I was stunned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_140.wav|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_141.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_142.wav|They have not been named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_143.wav|We are now up against it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_144.wav|We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_145.wav|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_146.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_147.wav|Well, he should know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_148.wav|I will tell you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_149.wav|I've put my own money into this project.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_150.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_151.wav|She is an expert on medical ethics.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_152.wav|It has to be now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_153.wav|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_154.wav|It is not like us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_155.wav|Seven people were later detained by police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_156.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_157.wav|They will do their own thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_158.wav|You had to go and see him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_159.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_160.wav|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_161.wav|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_162.wav|Blair's response was weak.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_163.wav|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_164.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_165.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_166.wav|He deserved the win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_167.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_168.wav|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_169.wav|They know no other way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_170.wav|I've been there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_171.wav|It's an idea.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_172.wav|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_173.wav|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_174.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_175.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_176.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_177.wav|Does this matter?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_178.wav|One was a lawyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_179.wav|I put the drawing down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_180.wav|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_181.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_182.wav|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_183.wav|It is a farce.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_184.wav|Peace was won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_185.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_186.wav|It was very frightened and dirty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_187.wav|Is that success?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_188.wav|The service from the other players was super.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_189.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_190.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_191.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_192.wav|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_193.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_194.wav|It's all about money, money, money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_195.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_196.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_197.wav|I don't want to use it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_198.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_199.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_200.wav|I had decided to quit the show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_201.wav|People must remain vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_202.wav|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_203.wav|He seemed to lose his focus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_204.wav|I might come back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_205.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_206.wav|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_207.wav|Because they didn't want to know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_208.wav|That has been the easy part.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_209.wav|But she was.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_210.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_211.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_212.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_213.wav|It's not before time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_214.wav|The report is due out next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_215.wav|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_216.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_217.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_218.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_219.wav|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_220.wav|We were awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_221.wav|We are so proud.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_222.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_223.wav|I can leave at the end of the day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_224.wav|Until they came to do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_225.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_226.wav|Wealth is relative.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_227.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_228.wav|You should be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_229.wav|It's quite nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_230.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_231.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_232.wav|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_233.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_234.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_235.wav|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_236.wav|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_237.wav|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_238.wav|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_239.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_240.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_241.wav|It was a hit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_242.wav|There's the mix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_243.wav|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_244.wav|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_245.wav|That could be in place by next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_246.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_247.wav|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_248.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_249.wav|Chelsea was a great club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_250.wav|We have to expand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_251.wav|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_253.wav|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_254.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_255.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_256.wav|Souter will be back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_257.wav|I am just trying to do my job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_258.wav|Blood samples were taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_259.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_260.wav|This is a question of Islam.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_262.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_263.wav|It's a way of life.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_265.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_266.wav|They seem to get away with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_267.wav|The record companies have gone through the floor.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_269.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_270.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_271.wav|We have to break that cycle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_272.wav|He looked very sharp.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_273.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_274.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_275.wav|You've got to have both sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_276.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_277.wav|Dialogue is the key.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_278.wav|It was a virus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_279.wav|Yet, it worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_280.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_281.wav|This is a national crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_282.wav|Who did the recruiting?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_283.wav|So I did.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_284.wav|We are not going to forget.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_285.wav|What has altered?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_286.wav|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_287.wav|There is no openness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_288.wav|I can live with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_289.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_290.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_291.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_292.wav|Last night was a key episode.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_293.wav|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_294.wav|You are the glory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_295.wav|The minister is the engineer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_296.wav|The letters are going out today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_297.wav|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way around.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_298.wav|Is there on his hands?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_299.wav|We are a peaceful people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_300.wav|Kids are terrible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_301.wav|Horses are drawn by ballot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_302.wav|My body is clearly capable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_303.wav|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_304.wav|They had a confession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_305.wav|It will work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_306.wav|I came into this world with nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_307.wav|It's too horrible to think.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_308.wav|Either team will be hard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_309.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_310.wav|My view has now completely changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_311.wav|The party is up for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_312.wav|Is that an issue?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_313.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_314.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_315.wav|The same things will happen with GM foods.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_316.wav|Who will do it?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_317.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_318.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_319.wav|Two people were interviewed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_320.wav|I'm very lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_321.wav|It's very good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_322.wav|This is a friendly match?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_323.wav|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_324.wav|They should take their mobile phones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_325.wav|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_326.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_327.wav|Tell us about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_328.wav|She said they would appeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_329.wav|But we finished the show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_330.wav|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_331.wav|There is no excuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_332.wav|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_333.wav|The pair are very much in love.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_334.wav|As, indeed, they would be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_335.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_336.wav|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_337.wav|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_338.wav|That would help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_339.wav|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_340.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_341.wav|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_342.wav|There was a substantial explosion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_343.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_344.wav|He could face a jail sentence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_345.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_346.wav|It's been hard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_347.wav|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_348.wav|A review is under way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_349.wav|Safety was also an issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_350.wav|So there, we won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_351.wav|He was the architect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p265/p265_352.wav|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_025.wav|She looked so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_026.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_027.wav|Is this accurate?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_028.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_029.wav|There's a story, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_030.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_031.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_032.wav|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_033.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_034.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_035.wav|It was clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_036.wav|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_037.wav|Indeed, he does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_038.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_039.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_040.wav|Dancing was her life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_041.wav|It's the only thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_042.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_043.wav|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_044.wav|A neighbour said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_045.wav|Among them are many criminals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_046.wav|Is a drug dealer?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_047.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_048.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_049.wav|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_050.wav|There was a substantial explosion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_051.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_052.wav|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_053.wav|I expect a rapid response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_054.wav|What was the main difference?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_055.wav|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_056.wav|They're appalled by that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_057.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_058.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_059.wav|We should have known.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_060.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_061.wav|We recorded it at our own expense.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_062.wav|Try to save us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_063.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_064.wav|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_065.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_066.wav|He was at home with his pals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_067.wav|It's all I can do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_068.wav|I was as strong as a horse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_069.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_070.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_071.wav|Neither it is.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_072.wav|It is a job creation scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_073.wav|It works for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_074.wav|The party is up for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_075.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_076.wav|Today she has been released.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_077.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_078.wav|I will miss him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_079.wav|He is in the queue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_080.wav|I first met him last summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_081.wav|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_082.wav|He is driven.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_083.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_084.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_085.wav|Someone who cares
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_086.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_087.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_088.wav|It will be tight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_089.wav|It is a lifeline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_090.wav|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_091.wav|It's good news.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_092.wav|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_093.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_094.wav|I love the Dome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_095.wav|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_096.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_097.wav|I saw the whole thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_098.wav|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_099.wav|Journalists should make him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_100.wav|May not have been at fault?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_101.wav|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_102.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_103.wav|That would be unlawful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_104.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_105.wav|He takes the job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_106.wav|She reflects a bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_107.wav|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_108.wav|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_109.wav|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_110.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_111.wav|It was a funny game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_112.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_113.wav|Is that right?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_114.wav|It is a total and utter change of culture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_115.wav|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_116.wav|It's a shame.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_117.wav|It was the eighties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_118.wav|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_119.wav|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_120.wav|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_121.wav|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_122.wav|Who would have?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_123.wav|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_124.wav|There were no grounds for his action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_125.wav|I'm so angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_126.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_127.wav|I was on a roll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_128.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_129.wav|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_130.wav|We work well together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_131.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_132.wav|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_133.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_134.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_135.wav|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_136.wav|Is that it?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_137.wav|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_138.wav|I was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_139.wav|I don't know the full story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_140.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_141.wav|Who would be right?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_142.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_143.wav|He realises his mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_144.wav|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_145.wav|I was awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_146.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_147.wav|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_148.wav|It is not just about pay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_149.wav|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_150.wav|So I got a blood test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_151.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_152.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_153.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_154.wav|They have not been named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_155.wav|I might come back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_156.wav|We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_157.wav|My Dad is a hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_158.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_159.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_160.wav|There's a pause.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_161.wav|Was this element always there?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_162.wav|I've put my own money into this project.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_163.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_164.wav|We need a new kind of theatre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_165.wav|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_166.wav|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_167.wav|We try to keep it right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_168.wav|Seven people were later detained by police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_169.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_170.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_171.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_172.wav|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_173.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_174.wav|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_175.wav|One season, they might do well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_176.wav|Is Saddam a threat?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_177.wav|As we worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_178.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_179.wav|I'm just going to hit the shot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_180.wav|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_181.wav|I've been there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_182.wav|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_183.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_184.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_186.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_187.wav|Our team is just so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_188.wav|O Neill has delivered.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_189.wav|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_190.wav|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_191.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_192.wav|I came home by ambulance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_193.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_194.wav|Is that success?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_195.wav|The service from the other players was super.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_196.wav|Tommy is not a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_197.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_198.wav|Who will pay for this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_199.wav|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_200.wav|It's just awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_201.wav|It's all about money, money, money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_202.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_203.wav|He knows a lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_204.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_205.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_206.wav|It's not before time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_207.wav|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_208.wav|We want to keep the pound.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_209.wav|I was so nervous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_210.wav|He seemed to lose his focus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_211.wav|Work has started.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_212.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_213.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_214.wav|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_215.wav|During the communist time they were very privileged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_216.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_217.wav|Saturday is gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_218.wav|Because they didn't want to know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_219.wav|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_220.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_221.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_222.wav|I will win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_223.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_224.wav|The report is due out next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_225.wav|We were awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_226.wav|They tried to give her advice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_227.wav|They have now become the focus of a huge police inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_228.wav|They will be stopped, and they will be punished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_229.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_230.wav|There is no excuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_231.wav|It's quite nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_232.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_233.wav|Of further privacy, he had no need.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_234.wav|It's a killer piece.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_235.wav|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_236.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_237.wav|It is hard won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_238.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_239.wav|You can feel at home in China.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_240.wav|The scene is about this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_241.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_242.wav|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_243.wav|My son was too young to die.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_244.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_245.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_246.wav|It was a hit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_247.wav|There's the mix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_248.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_249.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_250.wav|We are in a war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_251.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_252.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_253.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_254.wav|It was like the old days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_255.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_256.wav|Chelsea was a great club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_257.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_258.wav|We have to expand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_259.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_260.wav|Souter will be back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_261.wav|Note the date.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_262.wav|It will be done in stages.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_263.wav|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_264.wav|You take a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_265.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_266.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_267.wav|He was also married with two children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_268.wav|The system can work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_269.wav|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_270.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_271.wav|We're in shock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_272.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_273.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_274.wav|That goes back a long way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_275.wav|It was very fast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_276.wav|She failed in her action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_277.wav|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_278.wav|They seem to get away with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_279.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_280.wav|It's so awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_281.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_282.wav|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_283.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_284.wav|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_285.wav|Dialogue is the key.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_286.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_287.wav|Tony Blair said as little.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_288.wav|She is an expert on medical ethics.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_289.wav|It was good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_290.wav|Who did the recruiting?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_291.wav|Bombing slaughter rejected
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_292.wav|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_293.wav|It could well be military.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_294.wav|No Briton has ever won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_295.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_296.wav|Spent three months alone at sea.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_297.wav|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_298.wav|There was a vacuum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_299.wav|We lost a boy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_300.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_301.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_302.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_303.wav|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_304.wav|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_305.wav|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_306.wav|I can give no comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_307.wav|But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_308.wav|This is a war over our home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_309.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_310.wav|The plot is minimal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_311.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_312.wav|You should be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_313.wav|The minister is the engineer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_314.wav|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_315.wav|We have got no money to go anywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_316.wav|Your father was a good man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_317.wav|We are a peaceful people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_318.wav|You may have a short memory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_319.wav|The problems began a long time ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_320.wav|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_321.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_322.wav|A review is under way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_323.wav|We are in the end game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_324.wav|It's too horrible to think.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_325.wav|The airport was even different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_326.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_327.wav|There was no time scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_328.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_329.wav|Is there a new way forward?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_330.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_331.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_332.wav|However, they will only be found in the wild.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_333.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_334.wav|Who will do it?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_335.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_336.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_337.wav|Two people were interviewed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_338.wav|We've tried every other way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_339.wav|This is a big advantage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_340.wav|Maloney was asked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_341.wav|But I was knocked out by the city.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_342.wav|went on sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_343.wav|I'm very lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_344.wav|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_345.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_346.wav|It is long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_347.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_348.wav|Tell us about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_349.wav|There may be reasons for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_350.wav|I believe the gap is nearly there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_351.wav|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_352.wav|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_353.wav|She is free.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_354.wav|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_355.wav|You must have a government and a good civil service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_356.wav|Yet he left a few days later.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_357.wav|You have to rely on each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_358.wav|It was one in the afternoon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_359.wav|We will be homeless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_360.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_361.wav|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_362.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_363.wav|This is a club on the rise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_364.wav|Not so, it seems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_365.wav|He was also a great man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_366.wav|He could make it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_367.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_368.wav|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_369.wav|It's now down in black and white.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_370.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_371.wav|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_372.wav|It is a simple equation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_373.wav|So there, we won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_374.wav|But I managed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_375.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_376.wav|There is no signature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_377.wav|The task is enormous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_378.wav|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_379.wav|I am a wealthy person.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_380.wav|Colour was at the core of his life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_381.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_382.wav|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_384.wav|It's like a car crash.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_385.wav|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_386.wav|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_387.wav|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_388.wav|Does that put pressure on us?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_389.wav|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_390.wav|It is unusual.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_391.wav|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_392.wav|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_393.wav|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_394.wav|They are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_395.wav|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_396.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_397.wav|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_398.wav|What happened in the summer?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_399.wav|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_400.wav|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_401.wav|Emotions were complex.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_402.wav|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_403.wav|So I did.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_404.wav|It's an absolute nonsense.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_405.wav|I knew the script.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_406.wav|They were kept there for a summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_407.wav|The weekly average was three hours.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_408.wav|Relief was beyond belief.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_409.wav|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_410.wav|He got his degree.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_411.wav|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_412.wav|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_413.wav|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_414.wav|But we finished the show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_415.wav|He was really great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_416.wav|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_417.wav|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_418.wav|That may be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_419.wav|It is legally binding.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_420.wav|Paris is not only young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_421.wav|Such as it is.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_422.wav|It looked like a war zone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_423.wav|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p266/p266_424.wav|I chose to make a film.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_025.wav|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_026.wav|He may not need to force that message.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_027.wav|There is no reason at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_028.wav|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_029.wav|Because we do not need it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_030.wav|We will look into it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_031.wav|This is a central issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_032.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_033.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_034.wav|I became a widow overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_035.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_036.wav|A week is a long time in politics.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_037.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_038.wav|This represents a tough game for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_039.wav|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_040.wav|It is difficult for Ali.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_041.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_042.wav|He is too weak to move.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_043.wav|Everything else is a bonus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_044.wav|This is the interesting part.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_045.wav|I guess I was lucky, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_046.wav|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_047.wav|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_048.wav|There was no safety net.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_049.wav|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_050.wav|It is a different animal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_051.wav|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_052.wav|I must take a seat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_053.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_054.wav|Four other charges were dropped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_055.wav|So I liked the challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_056.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_057.wav|That way I won't have to do anything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_058.wav|It's just the timing of the game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_059.wav|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_060.wav|We need to increase the membership.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_061.wav|He was at home with his pals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_062.wav|They are in the euro.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_063.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_064.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_065.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_066.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_067.wav|There could be a way back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_068.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_069.wav|Her body was found on Monday morning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_070.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_071.wav|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_072.wav|A government is a government is a government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_073.wav|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_074.wav|That is bound to happen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_075.wav|He is in the queue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_076.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_077.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_078.wav|He can win every week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_079.wav|By then, he was walking on water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_080.wav|It's so hard to shift.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_081.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_082.wav|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_083.wav|There was no way back for United after that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_084.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_085.wav|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_086.wav|They need to find a form of words.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_087.wav|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_088.wav|It's for that reason he should resign.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_089.wav|The rescue package is public money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_090.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_091.wav|Our house was very small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_092.wav|They were a lovely couple.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_093.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_094.wav|It's not a lack of effort.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_095.wav|That means an extra two years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_096.wav|Then came the collision with Sergio.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_097.wav|It is a total and utter change of culture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_098.wav|Sport is good for you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_099.wav|We need to handle it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_100.wav|They will notice a difference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_102.wav|Such actions are rarely popular.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_103.wav|He has done that with a great deal to spare.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_104.wav|Then again, we could have.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_105.wav|She's got to say something.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_106.wav|I was always a little behind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_107.wav|There were no grounds for his action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_108.wav|That admission is not surprising.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_109.wav|We have a training class.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_110.wav|Well, you can have a tree.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_111.wav|Becoming a father was wonderful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_112.wav|I was on a roll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_113.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_114.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_115.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_116.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_117.wav|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_118.wav|We did what we had to do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_119.wav|I am the Son of Sam.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_120.wav|You've got to be vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_121.wav|Tiger is not the norm.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_122.wav|My conscience is not clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_123.wav|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_124.wav|It would make a lot of sense.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_125.wav|They could use a boost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_126.wav|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_127.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_128.wav|They scored with a penalty and a breakaway.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_129.wav|He was seen as the enemy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_130.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_131.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_132.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_133.wav|It was a piece of art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_134.wav|I am just trying to do my job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_135.wav|So I got a blood test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_136.wav|It has become a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_137.wav|I was caught out a little bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_138.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_139.wav|It has to be an event.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_140.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_141.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_142.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_143.wav|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_144.wav|It was by the numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_145.wav|We will turn the corner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_146.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_147.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_148.wav|There was a definite prejudice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_149.wav|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_150.wav|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_151.wav|Adams is surely worth a chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_152.wav|That is not too bad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_153.wav|We are still getting over it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_154.wav|As, indeed, they would be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_155.wav|We came across the first set of bodies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_156.wav|Seven people were later detained by police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_157.wav|I would probably have to agree with him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_158.wav|We were given a warm and friendly reception.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_159.wav|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_160.wav|Nobody did in those days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_161.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_162.wav|And does it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_163.wav|Are you from the rugby ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_164.wav|Had I heard ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_165.wav|Well, this article is a bit like that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_166.wav|It's nice to be nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_167.wav|The people are the hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_168.wav|I always felt they played for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_169.wav|It is premature to speculate on the impact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_170.wav|They made such decisions in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_171.wav|It is a body blow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_172.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_173.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_174.wav|It is not a threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_175.wav|I would not count on it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_176.wav|He played it like a veteran.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_177.wav|I have spoken to head office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_178.wav|The referee had a good game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_179.wav|The European Union is a case in point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_180.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_181.wav|It is a common problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_182.wav|A team is a team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_183.wav|Aberdeen had little to offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_184.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_185.wav|It was a pre-emptive strike.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_186.wav|A terrorist is a terrorist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_187.wav|People will ask about us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_188.wav|I had come back from London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_189.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_190.wav|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_191.wav|Final proposals will be published in February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_192.wav|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_193.wav|If I was a woman.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_194.wav|I came home by ambulance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_195.wav|I suggest a new plan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_196.wav|The conference is the first test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_197.wav|Tommy is not a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_198.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_199.wav|He had suffered a heart attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_200.wav|I won't make an official complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_201.wav|A bit of match fitness is required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_202.wav|It is an impressive record.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_203.wav|There is no quick fix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_204.wav|Abbey National is an option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_205.wav|It has been like that all year for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_206.wav|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_207.wav|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_208.wav|From there, they can go anywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_209.wav|I had relied on him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_210.wav|The course has helped a lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_211.wav|I'm just a regular person.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_212.wav|My life is in the ballet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_213.wav|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_214.wav|They're going to open in early summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_215.wav|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_216.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_217.wav|It is good for our team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_218.wav|It was a crazy day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_219.wav|Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_220.wav|Because they didn't want to know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_221.wav|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_222.wav|You have to do your research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_223.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_224.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_225.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_226.wav|What are you not good at ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_227.wav|William Hague delighted his party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_228.wav|You could feel the heat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_229.wav|Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_230.wav|The boy is no longer with us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_231.wav|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_232.wav|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_233.wav|My wife and family are the support system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_234.wav|And he goes with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_235.wav|They tried to give her advice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_236.wav|Pensions are a long-term investment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_237.wav|She died in middle age.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_238.wav|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_239.wav|Those overseas offices were great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_240.wav|You will have seen the adverts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_242.wav|It is the loss of my name.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_243.wav|The irony was not lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_244.wav|We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_245.wav|I am still waiting for a reply.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_246.wav|It is a court case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_247.wav|He has been a success this year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_248.wav|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_249.wav|He declined to give any details.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_250.wav|It seems a waste of talents.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_251.wav|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_252.wav|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_253.wav|His is a global perspective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_254.wav|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_255.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_256.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_257.wav|It was a cry for help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_258.wav|They were back in full training yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_259.wav|No production contract is yet in sight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_260.wav|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_261.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_262.wav|The capital costs are modest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_263.wav|It was the climax of the thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_264.wav|I can't get a job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_265.wav|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_266.wav|On the contrary they stand to gain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_267.wav|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_268.wav|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_269.wav|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_270.wav|It is also very valuable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_271.wav|It disappeared into the cup.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_272.wav|The stage was set for a showdown.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_273.wav|Not many companies can say that these days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_274.wav|He will emerge as a world leader.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_275.wav|We're trying to get rounded performers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_276.wav|A lot of their players have developed in the English league.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_277.wav|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_278.wav|It is set in Paris.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_279.wav|He has run a hell of a race.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_280.wav|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_281.wav|He was also married with two children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_282.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_283.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_284.wav|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_285.wav|That goes back a long way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_286.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_287.wav|was everything done to save people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_288.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_289.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_290.wav|Stephen will get his first cap.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_291.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_292.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_293.wav|We have a plan in place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_294.wav|I felt like I was a child.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_295.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_296.wav|He wants to talk a lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_297.wav|The attacker died in the crash.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_298.wav|It is inherent in society.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_299.wav|He refused to name the survivors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_300.wav|It's difficult to predict the future.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_301.wav|That is the general feeling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_302.wav|I am a retailer by nature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_303.wav|Well, he can do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_304.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_305.wav|The judge was really nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_306.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_307.wav|It is a potential danger.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_308.wav|The tournament has now been cancelled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_309.wav|Cast Away now on general release.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_310.wav|It is a road of death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_311.wav|We will make a statement tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_312.wav|There were no passengers on board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_313.wav|You will never get a conviction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_314.wav|I will not be afraid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_316.wav|He has left the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_317.wav|I am not concerned with protection of the public.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_318.wav|People can really get themselves in a mess.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_319.wav|I would do away with the dress code.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_320.wav|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_321.wav|He has been told by the doctor to rest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_322.wav|We want to play at the worlds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_323.wav|After some discussion they did.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_325.wav|It is all credit to them today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_326.wav|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_327.wav|You are looking at him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_328.wav|This is a source of real concern for the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_329.wav|It's not an easy life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_330.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_331.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_332.wav|The problems began a long time ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_333.wav|It makes a compelling display.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_334.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_335.wav|But the New Year was special.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_336.wav|They are now out in the cold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_337.wav|There was no time scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_338.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_339.wav|Did it work ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_340.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_341.wav|It was tough to contain the excitement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_342.wav|It is a strong case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_343.wav|A report is expected next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_344.wav|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_345.wav|They were the acts of men.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_346.wav|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_347.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_348.wav|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_349.wav|He is not very big, either.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_350.wav|I have a moral dilemma.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_351.wav|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_352.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_353.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_354.wav|Some will be deployed on submarines.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_355.wav|He did a good job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_356.wav|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_357.wav|It is a stroke of genius.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_358.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_359.wav|We live on an island.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_360.wav|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_361.wav|They have created a business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_362.wav|I got a yellow card.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_363.wav|I am considered a teenager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_364.wav|There may be reasons for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_365.wav|This is a major championship.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_366.wav|It's only a matter of scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_367.wav|She is now on the back benches.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_368.wav|They were to blame for the first two goals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_369.wav|There is no deal as yet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_370.wav|You must have a government and a good civil service.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_372.wav|The pair are very much in love.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_373.wav|They are used to the big stage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_374.wav|The marshall at the turn was great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_375.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_376.wav|The seller was not revealed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_377.wav|People are on the alert.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_378.wav|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_379.wav|In fact, he was great today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_380.wav|We operate as a Scottish company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_381.wav|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_382.wav|A review is under way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_383.wav|They have not done so this season so far.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_384.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_385.wav|Safety was also an issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_386.wav|We have made no final decisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_387.wav|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_388.wav|The results will take second place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_389.wav|It was a funny game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_390.wav|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_391.wav|It does not even have a staff shortage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_392.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_393.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_394.wav|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_395.wav|We shall not be moved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_396.wav|I watch the other visitors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_397.wav|I remain a buyer of the shares.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_398.wav|There were no plans for a rights issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_399.wav|That's all I can say.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_400.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_401.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_402.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_403.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_404.wav|You thought it was a headache.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_405.wav|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_406.wav|I thought he was an animal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_407.wav|None of the agencies was able to help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_408.wav|We will stand for the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_409.wav|I'm pleased about one thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_410.wav|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_411.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_412.wav|My aim is a top six finish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_413.wav|Such an attack is bizarre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_414.wav|These guys are looking for business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_415.wav|He is on the wrong side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_416.wav|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_417.wav|This is no reflection on Rangers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_418.wav|Further new equity was raised in a placing in January.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_419.wav|It needs to be volatile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_420.wav|I've got my own ideas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p267/p267_421.wav|Nobody should believe this story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_025.wav|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_026.wav|He got very close tonight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_027.wav|Smoking is also very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_028.wav|Wages and salaries account for a major proportion of our expenses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_029.wav|The first appeared to be successful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_030.wav|We must convince the citizens.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_031.wav|Carlton also declined to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_032.wav|She is employed on short-term contracts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_033.wav|Further management changes are planned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_034.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_035.wav|It's as we were yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_036.wav|We are opening an inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_037.wav|He works at the airport.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_038.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_039.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_040.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_041.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_042.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_043.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_044.wav|However, the purchase is as yet unproven.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_045.wav|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_046.wav|Something has to give sometime.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_047.wav|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_048.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_049.wav|The latter option was chosen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_050.wav|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_051.wav|The man became a reporter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_052.wav|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_053.wav|The thought of playing in the English Premiership has tremendous appeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_054.wav|Among them are many criminals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_055.wav|I knew my contract was up this year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_056.wav|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_057.wav|But it couldn't happen overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_058.wav|It was just too much for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_059.wav|Perhaps we should do the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_060.wav|They desperately want some stability.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_061.wav|Everything is possible in football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_062.wav|He looks like an Afghan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_063.wav|This trend is likely to strengthen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_064.wav|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_065.wav|He will need that machine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_066.wav|Debate was impassioned and furious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_067.wav|I would not say that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_068.wav|This was a far cry from his election pledges.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_069.wav|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_070.wav|The regional newspapers have outperformed the national titles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_071.wav|A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_072.wav|We deserved the three points.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_073.wav|The wingers must have felt the cold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_074.wav|I am relishing the challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_075.wav|Let's hope that it does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_076.wav|But the organisers refused to worry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_077.wav|We have to keep our clients.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_078.wav|We should be able to cope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_079.wav|He also had a Scottish grandfather.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_080.wav|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_081.wav|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_082.wav|But I had never been in a theatre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_083.wav|He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_084.wav|Kenny Miller might come through.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_085.wav|Scottish football is finally on its way back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_086.wav|He's not getting into any games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_087.wav|We will pay their bills.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_088.wav|It is time for new ways for the church.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_089.wav|It was exactly four months away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_090.wav|I am glad I wasn't in it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_091.wav|THE Farmer wants a new campaign.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_092.wav|In fact, I have even had a bet on them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_093.wav|Final proposals will be published in February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_094.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_095.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_096.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_097.wav|And does it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_098.wav|Are you from the rugby ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_099.wav|Had I heard ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_100.wav|What happened in that game ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_101.wav|Are you going to win ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_102.wav|You should try to have a laugh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_103.wav|There can be no compromise on welfare.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_104.wav|He will be kept informed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_105.wav|Maybe this battle has been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_106.wav|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_107.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_108.wav|Wilson made his remarks on Tuesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_109.wav|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_110.wav|Instead, another depression came in.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_111.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_112.wav|We have thought about doing lots of things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_113.wav|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_114.wav|Well, he is an artist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_115.wav|Everything else is a bonus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_116.wav|Harrowing is easy, after all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_117.wav|Those people must be accountable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_118.wav|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_119.wav|They would be supported by visiting specialists.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_120.wav|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_121.wav|Or so the story goes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_122.wav|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_123.wav|Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_124.wav|We shall rely on human beings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_125.wav|McPherson came from United Biscuits.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_126.wav|On Saturday, it was much the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_127.wav|The Breadwinner came home from Africa.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_128.wav|Their season has been consigned to history.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_129.wav|It wasn't possible to relax.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_130.wav|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_131.wav|But then they scored their fourth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_132.wav|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_133.wav|Monty is great in his own backyard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_134.wav|Brown also believes in Walker's innocence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_135.wav|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_137.wav|All the employees are redundant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_138.wav|Absences should be carefully monitored.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_139.wav|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_140.wav|The rise in retail sales was the first since August.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_141.wav|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_142.wav|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_143.wav|It wasn't about her singing, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_144.wav|He was forced to quit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_145.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_146.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_147.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_148.wav|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_149.wav|Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_150.wav|I was given no instructions by no-one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_151.wav|The move follows a review of the Singapore
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_152.wav|We're not taking any risks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_153.wav|It's very dangerous for markets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_154.wav|That's what happened against Ayr.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_155.wav|Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_156.wav|The following are the principal provisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_157.wav|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_158.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_160.wav|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_161.wav|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_162.wav|The milk industry is in turmoil.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_163.wav|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_164.wav|And so the cycle continues.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_165.wav|But the relief was short-lived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_166.wav|They exist in name alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_167.wav|YOU cannot blame the turnout.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_168.wav|We have reacted well to each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_169.wav|There were no plans for a rights issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_170.wav|I can see it now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_171.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_172.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_173.wav|Is it in the right place ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_174.wav|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_175.wav|There's still plenty time left.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_176.wav|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_177.wav|The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_178.wav|We are happy with the referee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_179.wav|Emergency services were also on stand-by outside.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_180.wav|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_181.wav|Pressure of work is no excuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_182.wav|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_183.wav|The hearing was due to continue today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_184.wav|His job was not advertised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_185.wav|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_186.wav|That was just one night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_187.wav|My father died in childbirth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_188.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_189.wav|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_190.wav|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_191.wav|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_192.wav|This is a frightening development.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_193.wav|In addition, margins have been maintained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_194.wav|Lee Westwood has other ideas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_195.wav|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_196.wav|Everyone around the club was supportive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_197.wav|You've got to be vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_198.wav|They have inherited the human rights abusers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_199.wav|This Patton will also return.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_200.wav|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_201.wav|You are a gambling man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_202.wav|It is all to do with the coaching.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_203.wav|There was a fine line to tread.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_204.wav|The refund is fully justified.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_205.wav|McCarthy said it would look at other means of tackling market abuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_206.wav|We believe a third party was involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_207.wav|I love the spectacle of cinema.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_208.wav|It would make a lot of sense.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_209.wav|I think he's the favourite, no question.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_210.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_211.wav|Bottling is now the core business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_212.wav|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_213.wav|I enjoy the creative process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_214.wav|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_215.wav|The whole thing was just unreal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_216.wav|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_217.wav|However, this concern appears to be misguided.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_218.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_219.wav|We had to add value.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_220.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_221.wav|My players have no idea about football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_222.wav|Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_223.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_224.wav|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_225.wav|So I got a blood test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_226.wav|Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_227.wav|He wants to be competing for titles and medals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_228.wav|There's always the next century.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_229.wav|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_230.wav|That proved enough to settle the home side down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_231.wav|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_232.wav|Years ago it was really quite simple.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_233.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_234.wav|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_235.wav|They've got some extremely good players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_236.wav|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_237.wav|And they removed a Borderer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_238.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_239.wav|Did it work ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_240.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_241.wav|It would seem a natural progression.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_242.wav|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_243.wav|We will turn the corner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_244.wav|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_245.wav|There was no basis for their arrest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_246.wav|This wasn't just a big crowd.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_247.wav|The best thing for me was to join the Army.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_248.wav|This is absolutely not true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_249.wav|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_250.wav|They should stop the bombing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_251.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_252.wav|I've come here for the jersey.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_253.wav|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_254.wav|The strong performance is expected to continue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_255.wav|Their extinction is not inevitable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_256.wav|It's never great to finish second.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_257.wav|Bin Laden was not mentioned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_258.wav|Allen is strong in every shape and form.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_259.wav|Her political persuasion is no secret.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_260.wav|We have a budget in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_261.wav|The Dutchman was pleased with the result.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_262.wav|You had to go and see him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_263.wav|The shoppers knew it before City investors did.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_264.wav|The planning appears to have paid off.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_265.wav|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_266.wav|We believe in the medium term.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_267.wav|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_268.wav|They were never seen again by friends or relatives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_269.wav|They could not match it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_270.wav|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_271.wav|A more exhaustive analysis is in progress.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_272.wav|I came up through the ranks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_273.wav|A warning may be sufficient to reform behaviour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_274.wav|Luckily, our patient was stable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_275.wav|They made such decisions in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_276.wav|Clearly, they had other problems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_277.wav|First, the programme was unbalanced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_278.wav|The happiness was slightly misplaced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_279.wav|Phase one was a shambles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_280.wav|If that's the case, he will struggle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_282.wav|A winter of discontent awaits.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_283.wav|But no party would win overall control of Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_284.wav|Injuries have taken their toll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_285.wav|Says the Duke of York.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_286.wav|How independent is that ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_287.wav|What form did that take ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_288.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_289.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_290.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_291.wav|When she went off it was quite amazing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_292.wav|Our destiny is in our own hands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_293.wav|The Royal Highland was no exception.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_294.wav|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_295.wav|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_296.wav|They need to be involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_297.wav|We've had great things in the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_298.wav|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_299.wav|It has been recorded twice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_300.wav|Aberdeen had little to offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_301.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_302.wav|This youngster is so exciting!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_303.wav|I'm interested in interesting work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_304.wav|They will probably come back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_305.wav|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_306.wav|It caused a lot of upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_307.wav|I saw them last week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_308.wav|Friday night was a pretty good night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_309.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_310.wav|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_311.wav|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_312.wav|Everyone can have their opinion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_313.wav|I was inspired by two things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_314.wav|It was a lovely sunset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_315.wav|Movie stars are public property.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_316.wav|It comes from reflection or thinking.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_329.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p268/p268_371.wav|He looked at me before replying.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of the number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_028.wav|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_029.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_030.wav|I have a theory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_031.wav|Is this accurate?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_032.wav|Because we do not need it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_033.wav|He took me on a tour of the wards.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_039.wav|That's no bad thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_040.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_041.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_042.wav|I was scared.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_043.wav|It was ugly.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_049.wav|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_050.wav|I was inspired by two things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_051.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_052.wav|It's very odd.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_053.wav|We have not given up hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_054.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_062.wav|Scotland had great assets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_063.wav|It's that kind of place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_064.wav|They are real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_065.wav|I've spent a lot of time on buses.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_073.wav|I was as strong as a horse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_074.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_084.wav|That is bound to happen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_085.wav|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_086.wav|All options are open.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_087.wav|Someone who cares
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_088.wav|By then, he was walking on water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_089.wav|You will be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_090.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_091.wav|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_092.wav|The name on the passport and other details have not been disclosed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_093.wav|Today I couldn't run on it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_094.wav|They've got to account for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_096.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_097.wav|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_098.wav|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_099.wav|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_100.wav|May not have been at fault?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_101.wav|We want to get to the final, anyway.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_102.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_103.wav|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_104.wav|No date has been set for the appeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_105.wav|It's not perfect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_106.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_107.wav|He pleaded for caution.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_108.wav|It was quite rigorous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_109.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_110.wav|I can't even get into the A team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_111.wav|The picture is the same across Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_112.wav|It was the eighties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_113.wav|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_114.wav|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_115.wav|Maybe this battle has been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_116.wav|My office is bare.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_117.wav|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_118.wav|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_119.wav|It was a delight on every level.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_121.wav|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_122.wav|She has been shot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_123.wav|I thought it was a fantastic game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_124.wav|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_125.wav|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_126.wav|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_127.wav|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_128.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_129.wav|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_130.wav|So the European elections are extremely important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_131.wav|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_132.wav|Who will attend?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_133.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_134.wav|We had a reunion last week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_135.wav|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_136.wav|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_137.wav|It's the big omission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_138.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_139.wav|What will happen then?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_140.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_141.wav|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_142.wav|It's a question of fashion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_143.wav|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_144.wav|It seems so long since I did the exams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_145.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_146.wav|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_147.wav|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_148.wav|He is severe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_149.wav|We just had a go.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_150.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_151.wav|We have seen a copy of the report.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_152.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_153.wav|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_154.wav|It's like a football team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_155.wav|It would be a last resort.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_156.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_157.wav|He will emerge as a world leader.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_158.wav|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_159.wav|I was so nervous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_160.wav|We want to see the maximum of change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_161.wav|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_162.wav|His death was a tragic accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_163.wav|This latter point is hugely important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_164.wav|It is so unfair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_165.wav|It is an attitude of mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_166.wav|I've put my own money into this project.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_167.wav|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_168.wav|I am now unemployed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_169.wav|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_170.wav|We have to move forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_171.wav|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_172.wav|I lost my head.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_173.wav|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_174.wav|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_175.wav|Waiting times for these services are too long.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_176.wav|They thought they had found a home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_177.wav|His team management was protective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_179.wav|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_180.wav|It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_181.wav|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_182.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_183.wav|Everyone can be bought.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_184.wav|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_185.wav|They know no other way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_186.wav|It's an idea.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_187.wav|They will run a mile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_188.wav|Four policemen were wounded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_189.wav|We did everything by the book.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_190.wav|Does this matter?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_191.wav|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_193.wav|It had been in place since last July.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_194.wav|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_195.wav|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_196.wav|We must keep our feet on the ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_197.wav|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_198.wav|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_199.wav|The conference is the first test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_200.wav|We played them off the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_201.wav|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_202.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_203.wav|It was good fun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_204.wav|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_205.wav|It's all about money, money, money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_206.wav|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_207.wav|I had been at the Evening Standard for two years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_208.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_209.wav|But I am a worried man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_210.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_211.wav|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_212.wav|Feel the heat?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_213.wav|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_214.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_215.wav|I began to pray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_216.wav|I am delighted for Simon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_217.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_218.wav|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_219.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_220.wav|The attacker has been put in foster care.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_221.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_222.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_223.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_224.wav|Who was on the panel?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_225.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_226.wav|It's so special.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_227.wav|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_228.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_229.wav|I have spoken to the skipper.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_230.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_231.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_232.wav|My neighbours are horrified.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_233.wav|But she was.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_234.wav|It's like a basketball.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_235.wav|And thought we would get away with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_236.wav|Of course, that is not the whole story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_237.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_238.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_239.wav|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_240.wav|It's quite nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_241.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_242.wav|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_243.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_244.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_245.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_246.wav|I know I'm in a very special position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_247.wav|You can feel at home in China.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_248.wav|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_249.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_250.wav|It's a record label, not a form of music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_251.wav|I was shocked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_252.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_253.wav|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_254.wav|Her presence was almost everywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_255.wav|I can't get a job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_256.wav|It is nearly there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_257.wav|Special measures were needed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_258.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_259.wav|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_260.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_261.wav|Kirkwood was arrested.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_263.wav|I am very angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_264.wav|It is also very valuable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_265.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_267.wav|The warning is timely.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_269.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_270.wav|They are never here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_271.wav|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_272.wav|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_273.wav|It left me with a sadness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_274.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_275.wav|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_276.wav|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_277.wav|They wanted the club to make money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_278.wav|It's a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_279.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_280.wav|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_281.wav|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_282.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_283.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_284.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_285.wav|It happens from time to time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_286.wav|If not, he should go home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_287.wav|They were too hard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_288.wav|I saw it at a ruck.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_289.wav|I intended to look for another club on loan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_290.wav|You've got to have both sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_291.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_292.wav|It was a virus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_293.wav|Who will perform?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_294.wav|It's like a high school play.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_295.wav|This is a national crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_296.wav|I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_300.wav|It changed my life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_301.wav|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_302.wav|Sunday's game was not a trial.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_308.wav|Graeme was prepared.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_309.wav|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_310.wav|But it's a subtle process.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_314.wav|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_315.wav|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_318.wav|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_319.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_322.wav|I did not name it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_323.wav|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_324.wav|We have got no money to go anywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_325.wav|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_327.wav|I was rubbish.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_333.wav|The problems began a long time ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_334.wav|Referees are easy targets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_335.wav|They had a confession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_336.wav|In the old days, it was easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_337.wav|However, the groups denied the claims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_338.wav|I came into this world with nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_339.wav|That's the law of the land.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_340.wav|There was no time scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_341.wav|It is a strong case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_342.wav|Is there a new way forward?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_343.wav|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_344.wav|The boat was fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_345.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_346.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_347.wav|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_348.wav|It's been hard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_349.wav|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_350.wav|It is a sign of hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_352.wav|It has moved on in the last week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_353.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_354.wav|You feel the pride.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_355.wav|The train was on time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_356.wav|It was so new, so exciting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_357.wav|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_358.wav|A great deal has been achieved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_359.wav|It was forced to divert.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_360.wav|It should be scrapped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_361.wav|It is long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_362.wav|I HAVE a dream.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_363.wav|Tyson is overwhelmed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_364.wav|As, indeed, they would be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_365.wav|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_366.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_367.wav|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_368.wav|We will be homeless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_369.wav|I expected these kind of questions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_370.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_371.wav|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_372.wav|It's a true story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_373.wav|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_374.wav|He later became a respected High Court judge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_375.wav|The play is based on a real-life event.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_376.wav|He could face a jail sentence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_377.wav|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_378.wav|They have not done so this season so far.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_379.wav|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_380.wav|They play together perfectly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_381.wav|It is a large number.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_382.wav|He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_383.wav|They haven't got a hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_384.wav|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_385.wav|He denied the charge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_386.wav|You can cope with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_387.wav|I am very happy with life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_388.wav|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_389.wav|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_391.wav|If you look at the other galleries in this area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_392.wav|In Scotland, we keep the faith.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_393.wav|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_394.wav|I'm pleased about one thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_395.wav|It is unusual.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_396.wav|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_397.wav|I suspect the latter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_398.wav|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_399.wav|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_400.wav|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_401.wav|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_402.wav|The car was just there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p269/p269_403.wav|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_025.wav|He was afraid to stay in hospital in Kosovo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_026.wav|They will not be allowed to succeed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_027.wav|Smoking is also very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_028.wav|Allan Johnston was not match fit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_029.wav|It was as if I had been stabbed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_030.wav|He has the courage of the unaware.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_031.wav|Drugs are a serious problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_032.wav|We have to find a way to put that right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_033.wav|That is the face of fear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_034.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_035.wav|Costs have got to be controlled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_036.wav|He really is a lovely man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_037.wav|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_038.wav|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_039.wav|This represents a tough game for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_040.wav|The boy is no longer with us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_041.wav|Among them are many criminals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_042.wav|Merger would be entirely logical.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_043.wav|Must be prepared to use it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_044.wav|Not if you know the person.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_045.wav|That was the theory, anyway.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_046.wav|I had come back from London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_047.wav|I had trouble with the producers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_048.wav|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_049.wav|My fitness was very poor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_050.wav|He also presented You Bet!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_051.wav|What do they want us to do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_052.wav|Is it worth it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_053.wav|Does it matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_054.wav|How do you take them away ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_055.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_056.wav|After the match, do you ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_057.wav|Because we do not need it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_058.wav|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_059.wav|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_060.wav|We have not given up hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_061.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_062.wav|We have made a commitment to those people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_063.wav|Have a look at our accounts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_064.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_065.wav|Final proposals will be published in February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_066.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_067.wav|It wasn't possible to relax.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_068.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_069.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_070.wav|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_071.wav|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_072.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_073.wav|She declined to give the reasons for the decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_074.wav|It is not in my nature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_075.wav|My immune system had been depleted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_076.wav|It was a unanimous decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_077.wav|It makes for an interesting conference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_078.wav|I've had it for the exams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_079.wav|I first met him last summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_080.wav|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_081.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_082.wav|Potions said he would drive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_083.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_084.wav|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_085.wav|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_086.wav|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_087.wav|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_088.wav|The peace process will be buried!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_089.wav|They must be on commission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_090.wav|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_091.wav|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_092.wav|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_093.wav|The move follows a review of the Singapore
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_094.wav|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_095.wav|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_096.wav|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_097.wav|But the battle has only just begun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_098.wav|In the end we made too many errors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_099.wav|That time is not now, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_100.wav|The following are the principal provisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_101.wav|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_102.wav|The new system will be marketed this summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_103.wav|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_104.wav|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_105.wav|I understand the medical concerns.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_106.wav|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_107.wav|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_108.wav|We deserve a significant rise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_109.wav|I would be prepared to go anywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_110.wav|You had better believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_111.wav|The website has changed the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_112.wav|This is a step backwards.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_113.wav|IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_114.wav|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_115.wav|Its replacement was not used in the exercise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_116.wav|The problem was a social problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_117.wav|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_118.wav|You were made to feel so welcome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_119.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_120.wav|You can spend money on housing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_121.wav|It's not a quick fix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_122.wav|That admission is not surprising.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_123.wav|Those people must be accountable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_124.wav|I've never seen a game like it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_125.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_126.wav|But we could only help a handful of people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_127.wav|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_128.wav|Becoming a father was wonderful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_129.wav|I was on a roll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_130.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_131.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_132.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_133.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_134.wav|So what happens next ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_135.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_136.wav|But beyond a fairly minimal level it has little impact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_137.wav|The first half was depressing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_138.wav|They made such decisions in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_139.wav|Italy was just behind the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_140.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_141.wav|I feel very grateful with everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_142.wav|There was an element of frustration.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_143.wav|Before it was an ordeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_144.wav|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_145.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_146.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_147.wav|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_148.wav|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_149.wav|We will provide immediate access.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_150.wav|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_151.wav|It is not disputed that the driver was at fault.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_152.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_153.wav|They have not been named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_154.wav|The transaction is not feasible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_155.wav|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_156.wav|We will turn the corner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_157.wav|My Dad is a hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_158.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_159.wav|Is our children learning ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_160.wav|How independent is that ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_161.wav|What form did that take ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_162.wav|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_163.wav|There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_164.wav|The woman was his wife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_165.wav|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_166.wav|Scotland came very close in the second Test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_167.wav|We did what we had to do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_168.wav|The strong performance is expected to continue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_169.wav|She returned to the theatre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_170.wav|It's nice to be involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_171.wav|That would open the gates of hell.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_172.wav|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_173.wav|Nobody did in those days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_174.wav|There is no signature on this document.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_175.wav|I would be very keen on a move to Italy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_176.wav|They could not match it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_177.wav|His team management was protective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_178.wav|The jury is still out.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_179.wav|The outcome is now in our own hands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_180.wav|City sentiment is in his favour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_181.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_182.wav|I'm pretty happy with the way I played.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_183.wav|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_184.wav|For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_185.wav|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_186.wav|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_187.wav|They receive a high profile in the media.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_188.wav|That's not fair to the supporters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_189.wav|They bought the property four years ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_190.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_191.wav|Miller was every bit as happy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_192.wav|You know the sort of thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_193.wav|They were seriously after him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_194.wav|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_195.wav|We represent a wide range of society.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_196.wav|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_197.wav|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_198.wav|I know every village and island on the west coast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_199.wav|Mr Blair was ready for him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_200.wav|He should emerge as the winner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_201.wav|In France, the reverse is true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_202.wav|I came home by ambulance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_203.wav|It comes from reflection or thinking.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_204.wav|They have the cash and the fire power.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_205.wav|We believe a third party was involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_206.wav|The early physical reports were clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_207.wav|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_208.wav|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_209.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_210.wav|This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_211.wav|I am very realistic about these things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_212.wav|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_213.wav|They are looking at a flotation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_214.wav|There can be no compromise on that demand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_215.wav|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_216.wav|It would appear to be a good time to invest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_217.wav|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_218.wav|From there, they can go anywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_219.wav|There is no excuse for domestic abuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_220.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_221.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_222.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_223.wav|Is it in the right place ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_224.wav|Did he trip ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_225.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_226.wav|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_227.wav|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_228.wav|They are difficult awards to decide.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_229.wav|I am considered a teenager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_230.wav|There's a chance they might come down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_231.wav|Yet the evidence is plain to see.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_232.wav|There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_233.wav|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_234.wav|People should make their own decisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_235.wav|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_236.wav|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_237.wav|That was a real challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_238.wav|His background is firmly in venture capital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_239.wav|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_240.wav|We were a shambles at the back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_241.wav|The scientific debate is dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_242.wav|They are the innocent victims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_243.wav|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_244.wav|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_245.wav|This would include the GM food industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_246.wav|And he goes with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_247.wav|It had so much to do with output.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_248.wav|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_249.wav|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_250.wav|The irony was not lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_251.wav|I might get an injury very easily.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_252.wav|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_253.wav|Everything depends on the weather.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_254.wav|This is a historic occasion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_255.wav|This championship is different from the other majors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_256.wav|Labour was too busy to respond.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_257.wav|I was just getting over the time difference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_258.wav|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_259.wav|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_260.wav|There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_261.wav|You're not getting any goodwill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_262.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_263.wav|No production contract is yet in sight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_264.wav|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_265.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_266.wav|We accept the new rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_267.wav|It is probably in the culture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_268.wav|He took over our lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_269.wav|I'd never run for them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_270.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_271.wav|What are you not good at ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_272.wav|I think, therefore I am ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_273.wav|Who was she ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_274.wav|Or was it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_275.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_276.wav|These figures are truly terrible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_277.wav|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_278.wav|He could see no other bidder.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_279.wav|There's not much money in cycling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_280.wav|None of this work is guaranteed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_281.wav|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_282.wav|Any error is severely punished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_283.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_284.wav|I understand the security issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_285.wav|It left me with a sadness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_286.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_287.wav|The target is to break even by Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_288.wav|It was never a free kick.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_289.wav|The manager's position was obviously included in that review.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_290.wav|It involved the same people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_291.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_292.wav|You have to expect this type of thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_293.wav|There's always the next century.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_294.wav|It's hard to see it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_295.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_296.wav|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_297.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_298.wav|I intended to look for another club on loan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_299.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_300.wav|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_301.wav|The rescue package is public money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_302.wav|He was overwhelmed by the response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_303.wav|The effect was almost magical.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_304.wav|It would be great to win the title again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_305.wav|It could well be military.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_306.wav|Selection is not in my hands at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_307.wav|His day had started much like any other Sunday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_308.wav|The songs are just so good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_309.wav|Sunday's game was not a trial.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_310.wav|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_311.wav|The world record is suspicious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_312.wav|There was no hint of scandal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_313.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_314.wav|Job losses were also announced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_315.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_316.wav|It is a road of death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_317.wav|The pound has also suffered.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_318.wav|He has left the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_319.wav|What happened in that game ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_320.wav|Are you going to win ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_321.wav|Was it the wife ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_322.wav|Why change it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_323.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_324.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_325.wav|People can really get themselves in a mess.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_326.wav|Survival is not an option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_327.wav|There will be good prospects ahead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_328.wav|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_329.wav|It is a court case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_330.wav|This isn't the end of story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_331.wav|It will set the tone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_332.wav|He will go a long way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_333.wav|It is far too early.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_334.wav|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_335.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_336.wav|Age is not like other forms of discrimination.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_337.wav|The next week is crucial.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_338.wav|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_339.wav|My body is clearly capable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_340.wav|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_341.wav|There was some merit in that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_342.wav|They were impressive against France.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_343.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_344.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_345.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_346.wav|And does it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_347.wav|Are you from the rugby ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_348.wav|He declined to comment on possible disposals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_349.wav|Nobody said it was required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_350.wav|This statement has never been withdrawn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_351.wav|It was tough to contain the excitement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_352.wav|Whether this return was too soon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_353.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_354.wav|There is a good example in this city.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_355.wav|It's wonderful to have won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_356.wav|He was at school in Devon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_357.wav|This decision is a farce.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_358.wav|My view has now completely changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_359.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_360.wav|We are satisfied with this outcome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_361.wav|We have very limited capacity.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_362.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_363.wav|An alternative must be offered.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_364.wav|The value of the merger is still there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_365.wav|Nobody else was with me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_366.wav|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_367.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_368.wav|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_369.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_370.wav|But BA said the prediction was premature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_371.wav|You need a licence to run a pub.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_372.wav|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_373.wav|I came here this week to work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_374.wav|They knew that I wanted to do something.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_375.wav|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_376.wav|He must have seen the movie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_377.wav|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_378.wav|She said they would appeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_379.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_380.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_381.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_382.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_383.wav|They were to blame for the first two goals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_384.wav|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_385.wav|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_386.wav|She is obviously very disappointed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_387.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_388.wav|Last season was very hard for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_389.wav|The parties include the Scottish Executive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_390.wav|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_391.wav|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_392.wav|I always knew she was funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_393.wav|Glasgow University declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_394.wav|It runs until the beginning of June.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_395.wav|It sounds like a wish list.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_396.wav|They have not got anyone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_397.wav|It has happened for generations.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_398.wav|There was a substantial explosion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_399.wav|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_400.wav|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_401.wav|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_402.wav|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_403.wav|There's still no-one like him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_404.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_405.wav|Ferguson must take the blame.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_406.wav|It's too close to call.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_407.wav|The breakdown was much later in her life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p270/p270_408.wav|Of course, it is nonsense.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_037.wav|It was clear.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_042.wav|We will push.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_043.wav|I hate the word.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_053.wav|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_054.wav|I guess I was lucky, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_055.wav|I was inspired by two things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_056.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_057.wav|I love the Dome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_058.wav|It's so awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_059.wav|It is unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_060.wav|I expect a rapid response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_061.wav|That's the truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_062.wav|Jobs could go.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_064.wav|Scotland had great assets.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_067.wav|It's good news and long overdue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_068.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_069.wav|We should have known.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_075.wav|There could be a way back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_076.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_077.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_078.wav|Neither it is.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_080.wav|The party is up for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_081.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_082.wav|He is in the queue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_083.wav|He is driven.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_084.wav|A play is a set of actions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_085.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_086.wav|Someone who cares
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_087.wav|By then, he was walking on water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_088.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_089.wav|They lived for their children.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_098.wav|It is annoying.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_099.wav|It is home-grown.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_100.wav|They are now divorced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_101.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_102.wav|I saw the whole thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_103.wav|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_104.wav|I'm not looking for a breakthrough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_105.wav|It is a love affair.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_107.wav|That would be unlawful.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_109.wav|He takes the job.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_111.wav|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_112.wav|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_118.wav|It is so sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_119.wav|You had better believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_120.wav|It's not fair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_121.wav|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_122.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_128.wav|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_129.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_130.wav|We work well together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_131.wav|What will happen then?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_132.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_133.wav|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_134.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_135.wav|It was very frightened and dirty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_136.wav|Is that it?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_137.wav|My daughter is an adult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_138.wav|He should resign.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_139.wav|I was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_140.wav|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_141.wav|It seems so long since I did the exams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_142.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_143.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_144.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_145.wav|He realises his mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_146.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_147.wav|I was awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_148.wav|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_149.wav|Note the date.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_150.wav|So I got a blood test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_151.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_152.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_153.wav|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_154.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_155.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_156.wav|Work has started.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_157.wav|My Dad is a hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_158.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_159.wav|Words were not required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_160.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_161.wav|That includes the equipment?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_162.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_163.wav|I'd love to be like Peter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_164.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_165.wav|It has to be now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_166.wav|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_167.wav|As, indeed, they would be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_168.wav|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_169.wav|They are not advertised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_170.wav|The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_171.wav|Tell it like it was?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_172.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_173.wav|We have a budget in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_174.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_175.wav|You had to go and see him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_176.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_177.wav|It is really good news.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_178.wav|He was a crazy man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_179.wav|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_180.wav|One season, they might do well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_181.wav|As we worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_182.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_183.wav|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_184.wav|If that's the case, he will struggle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_185.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_186.wav|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_187.wav|The goals were good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_188.wav|I've been there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_189.wav|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_190.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_191.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_192.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_193.wav|One was a lawyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_194.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_195.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_196.wav|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_197.wav|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_198.wav|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_199.wav|It is a farce.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_200.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_201.wav|I came home by ambulance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_202.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_203.wav|It opened last month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_204.wav|We believe a third party was involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_205.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_206.wav|Tommy is not a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_207.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_208.wav|He had suffered a heart attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_209.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_210.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_211.wav|I don't want to use it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_212.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_213.wav|You have a plan?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_214.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_215.wav|I had decided to quit the show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_216.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_217.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_218.wav|I might come back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_219.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_220.wav|That idea is rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_221.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_222.wav|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_223.wav|We could easily be cut again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_224.wav|He seemed to lose his focus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_225.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_226.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_227.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_228.wav|I will win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_229.wav|I am immensely sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_230.wav|It's not before time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_231.wav|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_232.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_233.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_234.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_235.wav|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_236.wav|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_237.wav|We were awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_238.wav|They tried to give her advice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_239.wav|We are so proud.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_240.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_241.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_242.wav|It's quite nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_243.wav|Three weeks later, he resigned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_244.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_245.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_246.wav|Of further privacy, he had no need.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_247.wav|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_248.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_249.wav|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_250.wav|It is hard won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_251.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_252.wav|You can feel at home in China.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_253.wav|The scene is about this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_254.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_255.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_256.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_257.wav|The concerns are the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_258.wav|That could be in place by next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_259.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_260.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_261.wav|Chelsea was a great club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_262.wav|Is that a serious question?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_263.wav|This is the first step.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_264.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_265.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_266.wav|Blood samples were taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_267.wav|We shall rely on human beings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_268.wav|This is a question of Islam.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_269.wav|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_270.wav|You take a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_271.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_272.wav|He was also married with two children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_273.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_274.wav|The prison has been affected by unrest in the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_275.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_276.wav|That goes back a long way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_277.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_278.wav|She failed in her action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_279.wav|They seem to get away with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_280.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_281.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_282.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_283.wav|We are a grandmother.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_284.wav|He looked very sharp.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_285.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_286.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_287.wav|You feel very helpless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_288.wav|You've got to have both sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_289.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_290.wav|It was a virus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_291.wav|She is an expert on medical ethics.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_292.wav|It's a record label, not a form of music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_293.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_294.wav|This is a national crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_295.wav|We are not going to forget.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_296.wav|No Briton has ever won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_297.wav|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_298.wav|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_299.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_300.wav|Nothing is safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_301.wav|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_302.wav|There is no openness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_303.wav|They are wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_304.wav|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_305.wav|This is a war over our home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_306.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_307.wav|The court had a number of empty seats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_308.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_309.wav|The plot is minimal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_310.wav|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_311.wav|There is no excuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_312.wav|The letters are going out today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_313.wav|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_314.wav|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_315.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_316.wav|My whole life has changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_317.wav|We are a peaceful people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_318.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_319.wav|Henman has been warned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_320.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_321.wav|For the moment, our position remains the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_322.wav|They had a confession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_323.wav|We are in the end game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_324.wav|It will work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_325.wav|It's too horrible to think.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_326.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_327.wav|There was no time scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_328.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_329.wav|It is a job creation scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_330.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_331.wav|Relief was beyond belief.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_332.wav|Is that an issue?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_333.wav|They should take their mobile phones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_334.wav|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_335.wav|The same things will happen with GM foods.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_336.wav|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_337.wav|Who will do it?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_338.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_339.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_340.wav|I've got no secret.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_341.wav|This is a big advantage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_342.wav|went on sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_343.wav|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_344.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_345.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_346.wav|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_347.wav|I got a yellow card.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_348.wav|We have big ideas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_349.wav|I believe the gap is nearly there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_350.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_351.wav|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_352.wav|Until they came to do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_353.wav|It is not like us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_354.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_355.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_356.wav|We will be homeless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_357.wav|That would help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_358.wav|My husband was angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_359.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_360.wav|It is a memorial.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_361.wav|And he laughs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_362.wav|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_363.wav|There was a substantial explosion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_364.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_365.wav|Their time has gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_366.wav|It has only been rumours.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_367.wav|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_368.wav|The death rates are still as high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_369.wav|Now, though, he has an incentive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_370.wav|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_371.wav|It seems a long time ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_372.wav|There is no signature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_373.wav|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_374.wav|It became a national network.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_375.wav|I am a wealthy person.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_376.wav|The BBC was a disgrace.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_377.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_378.wav|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_379.wav|It has been a lovely family occasion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_380.wav|That's the name of the game, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_381.wav|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_382.wav|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_383.wav|Yet the data is compelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_384.wav|It's a real problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_385.wav|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_386.wav|Who will provide the wine?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_387.wav|It is unusual.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_388.wav|They deserved the win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_389.wav|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_390.wav|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_391.wav|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_392.wav|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_393.wav|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_394.wav|But we are a young side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_395.wav|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_396.wav|It will take place in July.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_397.wav|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_398.wav|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_399.wav|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_400.wav|It is full-scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_401.wav|I never won a penny throughout my career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_402.wav|He will be judged by his actions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_403.wav|It is an absolute nonsense.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_404.wav|They are not left wing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_405.wav|They recorded their debut album in New York.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_406.wav|In a way he was.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_407.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_408.wav|It might be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_409.wav|The weekly average was three hours.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_410.wav|He scored a touchdown.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_411.wav|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_412.wav|He got his degree.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_413.wav|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_414.wav|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_415.wav|But we finished the show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_416.wav|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_417.wav|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_418.wav|That may be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_419.wav|It is legally binding.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_420.wav|Is there any prospect of this happening?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_421.wav|The service from the other players was super.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_422.wav|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_423.wav|Paris is not only young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_424.wav|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_425.wav|He is to appeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_426.wav|It was like someone had died.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_427.wav|I'm very grateful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_428.wav|The weather in the area of the crash was severe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_429.wav|We have the location, which is assured.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_430.wav|There is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_431.wav|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_432.wav|I know the worry over Iraq.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_433.wav|Everything has collapsed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_434.wav|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_435.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_436.wav|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_437.wav|We are all equal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_438.wav|Admission is free.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_439.wav|We are now up against it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_440.wav|In it went.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_441.wav|We were used.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_442.wav|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_443.wav|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_444.wav|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_445.wav|They were not even allowed to see them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_446.wav|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_447.wav|Bill is a mentor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_448.wav|We are certainly moving in the right direction as a club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_449.wav|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_450.wav|Was it worth it?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_451.wav|It was ignored.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_452.wav|It is bizarre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_453.wav|It had been in place since last July.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p271/p271_454.wav|It's a miracle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_025.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_026.wav|Is this accurate?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_027.wav|They have no history.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_028.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_029.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_030.wav|There's a story, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_031.wav|This is the window.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_032.wav|He was jailed for five years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_033.wav|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_034.wav|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_035.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_036.wav|Was it worth it?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_037.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_038.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_039.wav|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_040.wav|They're just different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_041.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_042.wav|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_043.wav|Indeed, he does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_044.wav|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_045.wav|He's just in it for himself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_046.wav|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_047.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_048.wav|We will push.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_049.wav|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_050.wav|This represents a tough game for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_051.wav|It is bizarre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_052.wav|They said she was stable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_053.wav|Is a drug dealer?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_054.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_055.wav|He is too weak to move.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_056.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_057.wav|He looks like an Afghan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_058.wav|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_059.wav|Here's a clue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_060.wav|It had been in place since last July.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_061.wav|Next league matches Celtic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_062.wav|There was no safety net.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_063.wav|It is unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_064.wav|That's the truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_065.wav|They are ready.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_066.wav|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_067.wav|I feel I did not have enough time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_068.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_069.wav|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_070.wav|They are real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_071.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_072.wav|That was a gold medal for certain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_073.wav|He was popular.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_074.wav|But I've won both ways.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_075.wav|There was an e-mail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_076.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_077.wav|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_078.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_079.wav|I had my suspicions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_080.wav|He was at home with his pals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_081.wav|It was magic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_082.wav|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_083.wav|It is a job creation scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_084.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_085.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_086.wav|Today she has been released.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_087.wav|He is in the queue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_088.wav|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_089.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_090.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_091.wav|Someone who cares
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_092.wav|By then, he was walking on water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_093.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_094.wav|It is a blow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_095.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_096.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_097.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_098.wav|Today I couldn't run on it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_099.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_100.wav|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_101.wav|It was clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_102.wav|It is annoying.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_103.wav|But I was wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_104.wav|I love the Dome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_105.wav|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_106.wav|Our position remains unchanged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_107.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_108.wav|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_109.wav|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_110.wav|You should be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_111.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_112.wav|Two of the team became ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_113.wav|He takes the job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_114.wav|She reflects a bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_115.wav|I am just trying to do my job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_116.wav|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_117.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_118.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_119.wav|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_120.wav|It is so sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_121.wav|The mood is upbeat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_122.wav|It is rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_123.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_124.wav|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_125.wav|Who would have?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_126.wav|There were no grounds for his action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_127.wav|I can't even get into the A team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_128.wav|I'm so angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_129.wav|She really suffered for her art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_130.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_131.wav|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_132.wav|No production was achieved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_133.wav|The BBC was a disgrace.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_134.wav|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_135.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_136.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_137.wav|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_138.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_139.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_140.wav|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_141.wav|I had decided to quit the show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_142.wav|We want to keep the pound.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_143.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_144.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_145.wav|Who would be right?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_146.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_147.wav|He realises his mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_148.wav|The role of the law lords would be retained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_149.wav|It is not just about pay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_150.wav|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_151.wav|So I got a blood test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_152.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_153.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_154.wav|I was so nervous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_155.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_156.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_157.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_158.wav|We are on a four-year mission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_159.wav|They should come clean.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_160.wav|My Dad is a hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_161.wav|He can do no wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_162.wav|Well, he should know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_163.wav|It is so unfair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_164.wav|I will tell you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_165.wav|I've put my own money into this project.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_166.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_167.wav|It is not like us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_168.wav|We've all had the shots.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_169.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_170.wav|Again, we were lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_171.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_172.wav|Does that put pressure on us?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_173.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_174.wav|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_175.wav|As we worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_176.wav|Tony had arrived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_177.wav|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_178.wav|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_179.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_180.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_181.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_182.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_183.wav|Our team is just so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_184.wav|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_185.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_186.wav|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_187.wav|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_188.wav|Peace was won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_189.wav|It's a fact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_190.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_191.wav|We believe a third party was involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_192.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_193.wav|Tommy is not a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_194.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_195.wav|But she might be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_196.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_197.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_198.wav|They make a selective perception process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_199.wav|We have an election in eight days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_200.wav|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_201.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_202.wav|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_203.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_204.wav|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_205.wav|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_206.wav|In each case they were a goal down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_207.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_208.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_209.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_210.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_211.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_212.wav|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_213.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_214.wav|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_215.wav|It's not before time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_216.wav|The report is due out next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_217.wav|But she was.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_218.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_219.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_220.wav|They must do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_221.wav|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_222.wav|However, no further action was taken by police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_223.wav|Until they came to do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_224.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_225.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_226.wav|There is no excuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_227.wav|Three weeks later, he resigned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_228.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_229.wav|But it's a subtle process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_230.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_231.wav|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_232.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_233.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_234.wav|It is hard won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_235.wav|Our policy is clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_236.wav|The scene is about this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_237.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_238.wav|There wasn't a goal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_239.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_240.wav|There's the mix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_241.wav|The concerns are the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_242.wav|I can't get a job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_243.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_244.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_245.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_246.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_247.wav|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_248.wav|Is that a serious question?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_249.wav|This is the first step.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_250.wav|They must play for each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_251.wav|Souter will be back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_252.wav|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_253.wav|Blood samples were taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_254.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_255.wav|We shall rely on human beings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_256.wav|This is a question of Islam.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_257.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_258.wav|Immediate action must be taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_259.wav|It's very nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_260.wav|He was also married with two children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_261.wav|The system can work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_262.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_263.wav|We're in shock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_264.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_265.wav|It's a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_266.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_267.wav|It was very fast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_268.wav|The record companies have gone through the floor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_269.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_270.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_271.wav|If not, he should go home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_272.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_273.wav|He looked very sharp.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_274.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_275.wav|All options are open.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_276.wav|Dialogue is the key.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_277.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_278.wav|It was a virus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_279.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_280.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_281.wav|This is a national crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_282.wav|It was good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_283.wav|Who did the recruiting?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_284.wav|Bombing slaughter rejected
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_285.wav|The songs are just so good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_286.wav|The goals will come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_287.wav|There's a pause.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_288.wav|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_289.wav|I was the sheep.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_290.wav|What has altered?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_291.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_292.wav|Nothing is safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_293.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_294.wav|One was a lawyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_295.wav|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_296.wav|They are wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_297.wav|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_298.wav|The plot is minimal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_299.wav|You are the glory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_300.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_301.wav|The letters are going out today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_302.wav|We want to play at the worlds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_303.wav|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_304.wav|My whole life has changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_305.wav|We are a peaceful people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_306.wav|You may have a short memory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_307.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_308.wav|My body is clearly capable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_309.wav|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_310.wav|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_311.wav|A review is under way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_312.wav|It will work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_313.wav|I came into this world with nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_314.wav|It's too horrible to think.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_315.wav|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_316.wav|Off with their heads.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_317.wav|Is there a new way forward?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_318.wav|I was invited to work in Germany.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_319.wav|Is that an issue?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_320.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_321.wav|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_322.wav|The same things will happen with GM foods.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_323.wav|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_324.wav|It sounded as if it might well be tragic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_325.wav|Well, it won't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_326.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_327.wav|Two people were interviewed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_328.wav|I've got no secret.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_329.wav|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_330.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_331.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_332.wav|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_333.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_334.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_335.wav|He loves the big occasions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_336.wav|The performance was excellent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_337.wav|That has been lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_338.wav|Tell us about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_339.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_340.wav|She said they would appeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_341.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_342.wav|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_343.wav|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_344.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_345.wav|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_346.wav|As, indeed, they would be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_347.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_348.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_349.wav|We will be homeless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_350.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_351.wav|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_352.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_353.wav|There was a substantial explosion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_354.wav|Not so, it seems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_355.wav|He could make it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_356.wav|Four policemen were wounded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_357.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_358.wav|It's now down in black and white.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_359.wav|Now, though, he has an incentive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_360.wav|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_361.wav|They have not done so this season so far.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_362.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_363.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_364.wav|So there, we won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_365.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_366.wav|There is no signature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_367.wav|It was a funny game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_368.wav|He was the architect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_369.wav|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_370.wav|I've never seen a game like it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_371.wav|I am a wealthy person.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_372.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_373.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_374.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_375.wav|Something is wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_376.wav|You can cope with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_377.wav|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_378.wav|That's the name of the game, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_379.wav|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_380.wav|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_381.wav|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_382.wav|At the last I found a bunker.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_383.wav|Yet the data is compelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_384.wav|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_385.wav|It's a real problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_386.wav|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_387.wav|I was in the train station overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_388.wav|It is unusual.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_389.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_390.wav|It's like a basketball.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_391.wav|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_392.wav|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_393.wav|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_394.wav|It was a kind of contempt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_395.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_396.wav|The car was just there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_397.wav|It will take place in July.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_398.wav|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_399.wav|Is that possible?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_400.wav|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_401.wav|What was the difference between them?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_402.wav|Emotions were complex.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_403.wav|Then , he laughs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_404.wav|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_405.wav|It is an absolute nonsense.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_406.wav|They recorded their debut album in New York.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_407.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_408.wav|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_409.wav|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_410.wav|Feel the air, the space.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_411.wav|He got his degree.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p272/p272_412.wav|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, and its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_025.wav|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_026.wav|It was as if I had been stabbed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_027.wav|Because we do not need it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_028.wav|It is about control of our economy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_029.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_030.wav|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_031.wav|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_032.wav|It carries a double message.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_033.wav|That is the face of fear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_034.wav|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_035.wav|Among them are many criminals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_036.wav|This will save interest charges.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_037.wav|Every aspect of our play was first class.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_038.wav|He looks like an Afghan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_039.wav|Everything else is a bonus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_040.wav|People want to see me on the screen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_041.wav|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_042.wav|I was inspired by two things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_043.wav|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_044.wav|My fitness was very poor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_045.wav|We have to look beyond the very short term.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_046.wav|The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_047.wav|I expect a rapid response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_048.wav|I must take a seat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_049.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_050.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_051.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_052.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_053.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_054.wav|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_055.wav|Let's hope that it does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_056.wav|We have to keep our clients.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_057.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_058.wav|We will pay their bills.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_059.wav|It was exactly four months away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_060.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_061.wav|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_062.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_063.wav|The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_064.wav|I was as strong as a horse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_065.wav|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_066.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_067.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_068.wav|The creditors have lost a lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_069.wav|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_070.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_071.wav|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_072.wav|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_073.wav|It makes for an interesting conference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_074.wav|This view was echoed by another Scottish analyst.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_075.wav|No progress has been made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_076.wav|He has been a success this year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_077.wav|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_078.wav|We have to offer value for money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_079.wav|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_080.wav|It's so hard to shift.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_081.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_082.wav|Potions said he would drive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_083.wav|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_084.wav|He had missed a penalty against the English.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_085.wav|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_086.wav|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_087.wav|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_088.wav|It was clear on Thursday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_089.wav|It was a family tragedy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_090.wav|It's not a holiday time for football players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_091.wav|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_092.wav|He was prepared for this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_093.wav|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_094.wav|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_095.wav|We intend to change the model.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_096.wav|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_097.wav|But the battle has only just begun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_098.wav|The following are the principal provisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_099.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_100.wav|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_101.wav|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_102.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_103.wav|We deserve a significant rise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_104.wav|Got to win today, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_105.wav|The pressure is on them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_106.wav|New Year will be very busy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_107.wav|There's still plenty of time left.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_108.wav|I didn't think so either.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_109.wav|He thought she was amazing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_110.wav|I came here this week to work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_111.wav|Then again, we could have.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_112.wav|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_113.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_114.wav|We would make a start.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_115.wav|His job was not advertised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_116.wav|This is a frightening development.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_117.wav|Which can happen any time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_118.wav|That is far too high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_119.wav|My life has changed a lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_120.wav|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_121.wav|That would open the gates of hell.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_122.wav|You are a gambling man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_123.wav|It feels like a privilege.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_124.wav|That is the ultimate revenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_125.wav|I am totally devoted to this job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_126.wav|We'll have to think about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_127.wav|I love the spectacle of cinema.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_128.wav|The findings are published in the British Journal of Cancer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_129.wav|I'm so grateful for that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_130.wav|The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_131.wav|There's always the next century.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_132.wav|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_133.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_134.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_135.wav|Behind him was his brother.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_136.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_137.wav|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_138.wav|It would seem a natural progression.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_139.wav|It was a terrible combination of factors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_140.wav|Today is not a victory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_141.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_142.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_143.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_144.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_145.wav|And does it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_146.wav|Are you from the rugby ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_147.wav|Had I heard ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_148.wav|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_149.wav|They should stop the bombing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_150.wav|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_151.wav|I'm not going to answer that right now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_152.wav|It's never great to finish second.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_153.wav|The long-term trend is certainly moving towards a balance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_154.wav|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_155.wav|They could not match it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_156.wav|I always felt they played for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_157.wav|His team management was protective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_158.wav|One season, they might do well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_159.wav|The jury is still out.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_160.wav|Phase one was a shambles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_161.wav|I did not have a bet on myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_162.wav|It is also very valuable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_163.wav|For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_164.wav|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_165.wav|Says the Duke of York.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_166.wav|They bought the property four years ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_167.wav|Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_168.wav|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_169.wav|You know the sort of thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_170.wav|It was a bit like having children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_171.wav|It shows the strength of the roots.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_172.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_173.wav|This youngster is so exciting!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_174.wav|Two years later, she was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_175.wav|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_176.wav|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_177.wav|Everyone can have their opinion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_178.wav|Because he was born in England.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_179.wav|I came home by ambulance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_180.wav|What happened in that game ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_181.wav|Are you going to win ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_182.wav|Was it the wife ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_183.wav|Why change it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_184.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_185.wav|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_186.wav|It comes from reflection or thinking.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_187.wav|It was a moment of madness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_188.wav|They have the cash and the fire power.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_189.wav|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_190.wav|The early physical reports were clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_191.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_192.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_193.wav|It gave no further details.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_194.wav|Little is known about them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_195.wav|I won't make an official complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_196.wav|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_197.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_198.wav|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_199.wav|His injury was completely random.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_200.wav|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_201.wav|From there, they can go anywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_202.wav|I'm just a regular person.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_203.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_204.wav|The statement contained no surprises.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_205.wav|His third goal was superb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_206.wav|It will affect their work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_207.wav|I am considered a teenager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_208.wav|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_209.wav|There's a chance they might come down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_210.wav|The transaction is not feasible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_211.wav|He remains a main board director of Royal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_212.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_213.wav|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_214.wav|He later paid a tribute to his opponent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_216.wav|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_217.wav|William Hague delighted his party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_218.wav|You could feel the heat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_219.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_220.wav|I have spoken to the skipper.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_221.wav|That was a problem for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_222.wav|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_223.wav|They would have to go to the Royal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_224.wav|But he failed to win the committee's support.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_225.wav|He is obviously very dangerous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_226.wav|It depends on Labour, not on us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_227.wav|It had so much to do with the output.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_228.wav|We have not been approached.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_229.wav|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_230.wav|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_231.wav|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_232.wav|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_233.wav|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_234.wav|The irony was not lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_235.wav|He said the move followed a downturn in business travel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_236.wav|My future is in the marathon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_237.wav|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_238.wav|We were well worth the win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_239.wav|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_240.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_241.wav|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_242.wav|You can feel at home in China.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_243.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_244.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_245.wav|What are you not good at ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_246.wav|I think, therefore I am ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_247.wav|Who was she ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_248.wav|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_249.wav|We have no information on Iraq.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_250.wav|Paterson can afford to be generous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_251.wav|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_252.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_253.wav|It makes no difference to their friendship.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_254.wav|No production contract is yet in sight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_255.wav|It was the climax of the thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_256.wav|We accept the new rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_257.wav|On the contrary they stand to gain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_258.wav|It was a minor incident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_259.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_260.wav|He took over our lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_261.wav|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_262.wav|I'd never run for them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_263.wav|Her body has never been found.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_264.wav|This will look at consumer attitudes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_265.wav|He could see no other bidder.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_266.wav|There's not much money in cycling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_267.wav|The demand is created by the supply.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_268.wav|We're trying to get rounded performers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_269.wav|Any error is severely punished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_270.wav|Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_271.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_272.wav|It was a horrible moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_273.wav|Truth is the child of time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_274.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_275.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_276.wav|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_277.wav|It was never a free kick.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_278.wav|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_279.wav|This is a great opportunity for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_280.wav|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_281.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_282.wav|You have to expect this type of thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_283.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_284.wav|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_285.wav|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_286.wav|The response from everyone was wonderful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_287.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_288.wav|The circumstances have changed since last year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_289.wav|It's all designed to speed up the service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_290.wav|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_291.wav|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_292.wav|Tony Blair said as little.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_293.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_294.wav|was everything done to save the people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_295.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_296.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_297.wav|Is it in the right place ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_298.wav|The rescue package is public money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_299.wav|The effect was almost magical.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_300.wav|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_301.wav|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_302.wav|Holland won by five wickets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_303.wav|His appeal is instantly understood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_304.wav|The songs are just so good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_305.wav|I can hardly believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_306.wav|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_307.wav|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_308.wav|The world record is suspicious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_309.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_310.wav|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_311.wav|Job losses were also announced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_312.wav|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_313.wav|The pound has also suffered.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_314.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_316.wav|Scotland has shown the way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_317.wav|You are talking about a matter of life and death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_318.wav|Leading share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_319.wav|The letters are going out today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_320.wav|He will go a long way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_321.wav|We will listen to any suggestion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_322.wav|But it is a slow process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_323.wav|The woman is basically off her head.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_324.wav|Mr Clinton was asked about his memory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_325.wav|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_326.wav|Other musicians were found in retirement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_327.wav|It is a terrible state of affairs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_328.wav|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_329.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_330.wav|They will have to cut through the roof.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_331.wav|The airport was even different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_332.wav|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_333.wav|He declined to comment on possible disposals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_334.wav|Nobody said it was required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_335.wav|It was tough to contain the excitement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_336.wav|Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_337.wav|Whether this return was too soon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_338.wav|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_339.wav|It's wonderful to have won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_340.wav|He was at school in Devon.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_342.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_343.wav|I have a moral dilemma.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_344.wav|My view has now completely changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_345.wav|There was a definite prejudice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_346.wav|The strong pound also took its toll.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_359.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_360.wav|Is there a waiting list ?

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_365.wav|That is a crazy situation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_366.wav|We are really good friends.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_367.wav|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_376.wav|It was like a weekly wage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_377.wav|In due course the deal was done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_378.wav|to have products for their needs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_379.wav|The pair are very much in love.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_402.wav|It's too close to call.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p273/p273_403.wav|It is a large number.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. )
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_025.wav|I can't play the game for them.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_029.wav|Not if you know the person.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_030.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_031.wav|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_032.wav|Costs have got to be controlled.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_042.wav|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_043.wav|He will need that machine.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_044.wav|People want to see me on the screen.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_045.wav|I had come back from London.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_050.wav|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_051.wav|The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_052.wav|The latter were not from Scotland.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_053.wav|We felt it was sufficient.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_054.wav|There's still plenty time left.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_055.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_076.wav|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_077.wav|There may be reasons for it.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_078.wav|I first met him last summer.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_093.wav|It was a family tragedy.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_115.wav|However, the problem is the timing.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_116.wav|Which can happen any time.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_117.wav|We had another last Tuesday.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_129.wav|how do you get it back ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_130.wav|That would open the gates of hell.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_185.wav|Women were mostly notable by their absence.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_186.wav|They responded well after the run of defeats.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_187.wav|It could be done by experts and lawyers.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_188.wav|The interim dividend has been passed.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_191.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_192.wav|I'm interested in interesting work.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_196.wav|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_197.wav|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_198.wav|Everyone can have their opinion.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_199.wav|He should emerge as the winner.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_200.wav|It comes from reflection or thinking.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_201.wav|That might mean another delay.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_202.wav|The early physical reports were clear.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_203.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_204.wav|The result is utterly compelling.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_206.wav|I won't make an official complaint.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_207.wav|It was worth a photograph.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_208.wav|Which isn't a bad idea.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_209.wav|We have an election in eight days.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_216.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_217.wav|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_218.wav|It was a crazy day.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_219.wav|People should make their own decisions.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_220.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_221.wav|The red card was okay.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_229.wav|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_230.wav|The performance continues to improve.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_231.wav|A small number of new jobs will also be created.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_351.wav|He declined to comment on possible disposals.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_352.wav|It was tough to contain the excitement.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_353.wav|Either team will be hard.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_354.wav|The pain is still acute.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_356.wav|It's wonderful to have won.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_357.wav|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_358.wav|Governments will have to respond.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_359.wav|We have very limited capacity.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_368.wav|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_369.wav|I got a yellow card.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_370.wav|Does it matter ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_371.wav|How do you take them away ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_372.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_373.wav|After the match, do you ?)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_374.wav|It had been a magical moment.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_375.wav|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_376.wav|Yesterday was a statement of intent.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_377.wav|Those people must be accountable.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_380.wav|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_381.wav|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_382.wav|Both of those promises have already been honoured.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_383.wav|It was like a weekly wage.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_384.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_385.wav|It will be completed within a year.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_386.wav|The pair are very much in love.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_387.wav|Everything is now in place for Manchester.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_388.wav|The group will also become an Internet service provider.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_389.wav|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_390.wav|Glasgow University declined to comment.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_391.wav|It runs until the beginning of June.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_392.wav|He has earned the right to their respect.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_393.wav|The law would appear to be on our side.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_394.wav|The board meetings will be held in Edinburgh.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_396.wav|There was a substantial explosion.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_397.wav|It's never great to finish second.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_398.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_399.wav|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_400.wav|It has only been rumours.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_401.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_402.wav|Clark is back on top form.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_403.wav|We're not taking any risks.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_404.wav|Neither man has been charged.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_405.wav|The members have voted against it.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_406.wav|It's too close to call.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_407.wav|Nobody will be forced to work.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_408.wav|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_409.wav|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_410.wav|I've had a wonderful career.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_411.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_412.wav|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_413.wav|But the foundations have been laid.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_414.wav|That is the ultimate revenge.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_415.wav|It's just a training thing.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_416.wav|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_417.wav|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_418.wav|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_419.wav|The second goal was superb.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_420.wav|Hopefully, the answer is in the positive.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_421.wav|I was pleased with my own game.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_422.wav|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_423.wav|This should put downward pressure on inflation.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_424.wav|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_425.wav|The projections are very positive for South Africa.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_426.wav|Being captain of this club is fantastic.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_427.wav|Such an attack is bizarre.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_428.wav|It needs to be volatile.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_429.wav|I never had a childhood.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_430.wav|The need for any new UN resolutions will be put on hold.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_431.wav|A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_432.wav|The trial will open today.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_433.wav|There is another important factor.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_434.wav|This is a limited market.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_435.wav|Its failure is no surprise.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_436.wav|No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_437.wav|The Festival is prepared to help.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_438.wav|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_439.wav|His message was very simple.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_440.wav|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_441.wav|I didn't get to keep it.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_442.wav|Their condition is described as satisfactory.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_443.wav|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_444.wav|They are interior designers and architects.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_445.wav|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_446.wav|It wouldn't matter if he had.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_447.wav|No further details of expansion plans were given.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_448.wav|The villagers were shot in the head at short range.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_449.wav|It is pretty bad news.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_450.wav|We just thought it would be kept under the carpet.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_451.wav|It could cause a little bit of disruption.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_452.wav|But we have built a platform for next season.)
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p274/p274_453.wav|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.)

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_050.wav|Here's a clue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_051.wav|I had come back from London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_052.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_054.wav|That's the truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_055.wav|There's a danger.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_056.wav|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_090.wav|But I was wrong.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_110.wav|It was the eighties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_111.wav|It is a financial matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_112.wav|It is so sad.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_117.wav|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_118.wav|It is rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_119.wav|Who would be a referee?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_120.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_121.wav|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_123.wav|That's all right then.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_124.wav|I wouldn't have wanted any other way.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_136.wav|It's not true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_137.wav|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_138.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_139.wav|It was very frightened and dirty.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_143.wav|It seems so long since I did the exams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_144.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_145.wav|Who would be right?

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_154.wav|So I got a blood test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_155.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_156.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_157.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_158.wav|It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_159.wav|They have not been named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_160.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_161.wav|It was by the numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_162.wav|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_164.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_165.wav|Well, he should know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_166.wav|Was this element always there?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_167.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_168.wav|I was in the train station overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_169.wav|We've all had the shots.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_170.wav|Tell it like it was?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_171.wav|Seven people were later detained by police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_172.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_173.wav|You had to go and see him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_174.wav|In a way he was.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_175.wav|One season, they might do well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_176.wav|Is Saddam a threat?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_177.wav|As we worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_178.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_179.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_180.wav|He deserved the win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_181.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_182.wav|Tony had arrived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_183.wav|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_184.wav|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_185.wav|His name was unknown.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_186.wav|It's an idea.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_187.wav|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_188.wav|Four policemen were wounded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_189.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_190.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_191.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_192.wav|It is a farce.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_193.wav|Peace was won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_194.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_195.wav|Yet the data is compelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_196.wav|I came home by ambulance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_197.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_198.wav|I have a cold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_199.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_200.wav|Tommy is not a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_201.wav|Who will pay for this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_203.wav|But she might be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_205.wav|Some realism was needed about the time, resources and management.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_207.wav|I don't want to use it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_208.wav|Feel the heat?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_209.wav|He knows a lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_210.wav|You have a plan?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_211.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_212.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_213.wav|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_214.wav|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_215.wav|He seemed to lose his focus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_216.wav|Work has started.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_217.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_218.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_219.wav|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_220.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_221.wav|During the communist time they were very privileged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_222.wav|We could easily be cut again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_223.wav|Saturday is gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_224.wav|It's the Tate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_225.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_226.wav|I will win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_227.wav|The report is due out next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_228.wav|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_229.wav|He is in the queue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_230.wav|My wife and family are the support system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_231.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_233.wav|The parties have been given until today to respond.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_234.wav|Of course I was tempted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_235.wav|We will treat it like a World Cup match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_236.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_237.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_238.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_239.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_240.wav|It is hard won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_241.wav|Our policy is clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_242.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_243.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_244.wav|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_246.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_247.wav|It was a hit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_248.wav|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_249.wav|I can't get a job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_250.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_251.wav|Kirkwood was arrested.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_252.wav|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_253.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_254.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_255.wav|Is that a serious question?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_256.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_257.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_258.wav|Souter will be back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_259.wav|Blood samples were taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_260.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_261.wav|It will be done in stages.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_262.wav|This is a question of Islam.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_263.wav|That review will look at the management across the sector as a whole.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_264.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_265.wav|It's very nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_266.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_268.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_269.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_270.wav|It was very fast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_271.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_272.wav|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_273.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_274.wav|It's so awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_275.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_276.wav|We are a grandmother.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_277.wav|He looked very sharp.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_278.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_279.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_280.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_281.wav|You've got to have both sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_282.wav|It was a virus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_283.wav|Yet, it worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_284.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_285.wav|It was good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_286.wav|Who did the recruiting?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_287.wav|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_288.wav|Bombing slaughter rejected
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_289.wav|We are not going to forget.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_290.wav|I could never be cool.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_291.wav|Who can predict?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_292.wav|There was a vacuum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_293.wav|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_294.wav|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_295.wav|The tournament has now been cancelled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_296.wav|She is really magic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_297.wav|One was a lawyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_298.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_299.wav|There were no passengers on board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_300.wav|It could work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_301.wav|This is a war over our home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_302.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_303.wav|The court had a number of empty seats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_304.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_305.wav|The plot is minimal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_306.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_307.wav|There's no evidence he was ever there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_308.wav|You should be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_309.wav|The minister is the engineer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_310.wav|The letters are going out today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_311.wav|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_312.wav|We have got no money to go anywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_313.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_314.wav|We have got to get the points from this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_315.wav|My whole life has changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_316.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_317.wav|Kids are terrible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_320.wav|We are in the end game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_321.wav|Our message was inclusive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_322.wav|Off with their heads.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_323.wav|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_324.wav|My view has now completely changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_325.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_326.wav|Is that an issue?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_327.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_328.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_329.wav|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_330.wav|It's been hard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_331.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_332.wav|Who will do it?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_333.wav|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_334.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_335.wav|He also insisted that no concession had been made to the French.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_336.wav|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_337.wav|We are the gateway to justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_338.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_339.wav|Yet, for the money, he was not the man of the match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_340.wav|This is a friendly match?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_341.wav|I got a yellow card.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_342.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_343.wav|Tell us about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_344.wav|There may be reasons for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_345.wav|I believe the gap is nearly there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_346.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_347.wav|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_348.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_349.wav|She is free.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_350.wav|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_351.wav|Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_352.wav|The pair are very much in love.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_353.wav|It is not like us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_354.wav|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_355.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_356.wav|We will be homeless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_357.wav|That would help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_358.wav|It is a memorial.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_359.wav|This is a club on the rise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_360.wav|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_361.wav|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_362.wav|The death rates are still as high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_363.wav|He's been in a nursing home for two years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_364.wav|It's now down in black and white.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_365.wav|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_366.wav|They have not done so this season so far.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_367.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_368.wav|There is no signature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_369.wav|I am a wealthy person.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_370.wav|Colour was at the core of his life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_371.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_372.wav|It is hard to understand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_373.wav|Something is wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_374.wav|You can cope with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_375.wav|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_376.wav|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_377.wav|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_378.wav|It is the old story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_379.wav|It looked like a river.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_380.wav|It's a real problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_381.wav|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_382.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_383.wav|It's like a basketball.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_384.wav|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_385.wav|It can help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_386.wav|I love the thought of having a crack at the defending title.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_387.wav|They are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_388.wav|I'm glad I came.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_389.wav|But we are a young side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_390.wav|That set the tone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_391.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_392.wav|What happened in the summer?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_393.wav|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_394.wav|There were no immediate reports of injuries.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_395.wav|The prison has been affected by unrest in the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_396.wav|What was the difference between them?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_397.wav|He will be judged by his actions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_398.wav|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_399.wav|It is an absolute nonsense.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_400.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_402.wav|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_403.wav|It might be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_404.wav|Feel the air, the space.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_405.wav|He scored a touchdown.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_406.wav|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_407.wav|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_408.wav|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_409.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_410.wav|We went straight into the bedroom.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_411.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_413.wav|I am extremely cautious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_414.wav|Paris is not only young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_415.wav|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_416.wav|He is to appeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_417.wav|It all began as an accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_418.wav|We have to expand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_419.wav|There is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_420.wav|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_421.wav|I know the worry over Iraq.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_422.wav|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_423.wav|It's been a long, long journey.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_424.wav|We are now up against it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_425.wav|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_426.wav|I want a career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_427.wav|He deserved a red card.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_428.wav|And they replied.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p275/p275_429.wav|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_025.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_026.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_027.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_028.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_029.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_030.wav|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_031.wav|Smoking is also very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_032.wav|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_033.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_034.wav|He said police inquiries should not be conducted as political opportunism.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_035.wav|There was a rush of water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_036.wav|A fiver and I'll tell.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_037.wav|We speak about the performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_038.wav|She is employed on short-term contracts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_039.wav|Further management changes are planned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_040.wav|I can feel the sound inside.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_041.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_042.wav|He is married with three children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_043.wav|I might well have done so already.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_044.wav|This is slightly negative for inflation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_045.wav|And they had a case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_046.wav|We believe a third party was involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_047.wav|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_048.wav|It carried a double message.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_049.wav|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_050.wav|But not a penny has been paid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_051.wav|Perhaps it is eyeing a mortgage bank.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_052.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_053.wav|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_054.wav|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_055.wav|This represents a tough game for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_056.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_057.wav|Among them are many criminals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_058.wav|And they removed a Borderer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_059.wav|He is too weak to move.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_060.wav|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_061.wav|They desperately want some stability.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_062.wav|Everything is possible in football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_063.wav|We like being the underdogs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_064.wav|He looks like an Afghan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_065.wav|This trend is likely to strengthen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_066.wav|He will need that machine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_067.wav|Then they scored two goals to win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_068.wav|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_069.wav|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_070.wav|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_071.wav|Let's not be too despondent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_072.wav|There was no safety net.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_073.wav|The Government does not go far enough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_074.wav|He phoned the number in the brochure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_075.wav|A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_076.wav|He confirmed that the document was valid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_077.wav|The wingers must have felt the cold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_078.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_079.wav|I have made that offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_080.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_081.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_082.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_083.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_084.wav|The new deal will now be put to the officers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_085.wav|Carlton also declined to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_086.wav|But the organisers refused to worry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_087.wav|Webster was brought up in Glasgow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_088.wav|Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_089.wav|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_090.wav|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_091.wav|He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_092.wav|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_093.wav|Funding needs to be long term.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_094.wav|We should all be grateful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_095.wav|He's not getting into any games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_096.wav|The coach is a man who is very ambitious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_097.wav|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_098.wav|It was exactly four months away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_099.wav|This is equally relevant to the landowner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_100.wav|THE Farmer wants a new campaign.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_101.wav|We are satisfied with this outcome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_102.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_103.wav|It wasn't possible to relax.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_104.wav|Context is also very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_105.wav|There could be a way back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_106.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_107.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_108.wav|People had been talking about a fourth quarter rally.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_109.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_110.wav|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_111.wav|He's been active in Arabia.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_112.wav|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_113.wav|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_114.wav|It is sometimes like that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_115.wav|He was unprepared for this fight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_116.wav|I've had it for the exams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_117.wav|Those people must be accountable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_118.wav|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_119.wav|It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_120.wav|Choice is a good thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_121.wav|I am not very pleased.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_122.wav|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_123.wav|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_124.wav|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_125.wav|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_126.wav|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_127.wav|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_128.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_129.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_130.wav|Potions said he would drive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_131.wav|Diversions were put in place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_132.wav|The Queen Mother is dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_133.wav|No one person or small group could be singled out.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_134.wav|The excitement could hardly be contained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_135.wav|Margins are also in retreat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_136.wav|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_137.wav|He had missed a penalty against the English.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_138.wav|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_139.wav|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_140.wav|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_141.wav|Cutting ticket prices would certainly help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_142.wav|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_143.wav|Absences should be carefully monitored.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_144.wav|Four meetings have previously been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_145.wav|The rise in retail sales was the first since August.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_146.wav|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_147.wav|We just have to adapt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_148.wav|Are you from the rugby ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_149.wav|What happened in that game ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_150.wav|Are you going to win ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_151.wav|Was it the wife ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_152.wav|Why change it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_153.wav|And they all have a vote.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_154.wav|But they must believe in themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_155.wav|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_156.wav|Token gestures of tiny tax cuts will not do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_157.wav|We made a world record together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_158.wav|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_159.wav|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_160.wav|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_161.wav|They said so that I would look good in uniform.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_162.wav|A good actor doesn't think.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_163.wav|That's what happened against Ayr.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_164.wav|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_165.wav|He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_166.wav|It is a good lifestyle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_167.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_168.wav|City sentiment is in his favour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_169.wav|His job was not advertised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_170.wav|Nato has left them with no other option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_171.wav|Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_172.wav|He was just like a godfather to it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_173.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_174.wav|Yet the survey has been cautious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_175.wav|These people are now following their own Unison agenda.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_176.wav|It took five months to repair the damage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_177.wav|They exist in name alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_178.wav|Advice and counselling will be offered.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_179.wav|You had better believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_180.wav|It was a sobering experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_181.wav|I can see it now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_182.wav|There's still plenty time left.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_183.wav|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_184.wav|I've no idea how it works.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_185.wav|The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_186.wav|The festivals will be about having fun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_187.wav|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_188.wav|She is in good spirits.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_189.wav|The changes took effect from June.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_190.wav|As if that is an achievement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_191.wav|That will be the sweetness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_192.wav|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_193.wav|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_194.wav|There was a fossil on screen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_195.wav|The protest will go ahead as planned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_196.wav|I did not concentrate on my performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_197.wav|The feedback from them has been fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_198.wav|That admission is not surprising.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_199.wav|But he rejected calls for a public register of paedophiles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_200.wav|However, the problem is the timing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_201.wav|Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_202.wav|That was just one night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_203.wav|This is a frightening development.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_204.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_205.wav|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_206.wav|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_207.wav|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_208.wav|My father died in childbirth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_209.wav|It is quite a thing to watch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_210.wav|This should begin in October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_211.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_212.wav|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_213.wav|Some promoters made insulting offers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_214.wav|We did what we had to do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_215.wav|The squad is too small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_216.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_217.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_218.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_219.wav|What are you not good at ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_220.wav|I think, therefore I am ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_221.wav|You've got to be vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_222.wav|I learned that only yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_223.wav|It's been a humbling year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_224.wav|Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_225.wav|You are a gambling man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_226.wav|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_227.wav|My daughter is an adult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_228.wav|I would not say that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_229.wav|There was a fine line to tread.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_230.wav|The refund is fully justified.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_231.wav|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_232.wav|I never wanted a legal battle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_233.wav|It would make a lot of sense.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_234.wav|It was started almost by accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_235.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_236.wav|Bottling is now the core business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_237.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_238.wav|Had this been common practice ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_239.wav|What do they want us to do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_240.wav|Is it worth it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_241.wav|Does it matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_242.wav|How do you take them away ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_243.wav|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_244.wav|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_245.wav|We were right to be afraid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_247.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_248.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_249.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_250.wav|I COULD tell that Alastair Wilkie was energised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_251.wav|That view has not altered.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_252.wav|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_253.wav|For business, the benefits will be enormous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_254.wav|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_255.wav|Five years later, the deception continued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_256.wav|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_257.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_258.wav|I felt we deserved the three points.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_259.wav|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_260.wav|They've got some extremely good players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_261.wav|Mr Blair had done well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_262.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_263.wav|Then we will face the Danish champions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_264.wav|The family kept away from me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_265.wav|I would have been shot dead in bed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_266.wav|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_267.wav|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_268.wav|We will turn the corner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_269.wav|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_270.wav|My Dad is a hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_271.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_272.wav|was everything done to save people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_273.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_274.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_275.wav|Is it in the right place ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_276.wav|Did he trip ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_277.wav|This wasn't just a big crowd.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_278.wav|It was a terrible combination of factors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_279.wav|This is absolutely not true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_280.wav|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_281.wav|They should stop the bombing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_282.wav|Sunday's game against Celtic is huge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_283.wav|I've come here for the jersey.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_284.wav|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_285.wav|The strong performance is expected to continue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_286.wav|Their extinction is not inevitable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_287.wav|It's never great to finish second.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_288.wav|And, finally, I have good news for the songbirds of Glasgow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_289.wav|It's as eventful as it is momentous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_290.wav|We have a budget in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_291.wav|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_292.wav|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_293.wav|That would open the gates of hell.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_294.wav|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_295.wav|We've made a couple of albums.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_296.wav|A more exhaustive analysis is in progress.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_297.wav|We have to keep our clients.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_298.wav|Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_299.wav|First, the programme was unbalanced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_300.wav|Everything else is a bonus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_301.wav|This championship is different from the other majors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_302.wav|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_303.wav|Harrowing is easy, after all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_304.wav|Each case is treated on merit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_305.wav|A winter of discontent awaits.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_306.wav|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_307.wav|I am astonished at attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_308.wav|Says the Duke of York.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_309.wav|Our destiny is in our own hands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_310.wav|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_311.wav|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_312.wav|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_313.wav|We've had great things in the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_314.wav|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_315.wav|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_316.wav|It has been recorded twice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_317.wav|Aberdeen had little to offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_318.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_319.wav|I'm interested in interesting work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_320.wav|We represent a wide range of society.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_321.wav|It caused a lot of upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_322.wav|I saw them last week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_323.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_324.wav|Did it work ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_325.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_326.wav|Is our children learning ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_327.wav|How independent is that ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_328.wav|What form did that take ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_329.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_330.wav|Friday night was a pretty good night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_331.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_332.wav|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_333.wav|We are trying to clarify the issues.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_334.wav|I was inspired by two things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_335.wav|The Government has completely lost control of GM crops.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_336.wav|MOVIE stars are public property.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_337.wav|It comes from reflection or thinking.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_338.wav|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_339.wav|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_340.wav|Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_341.wav|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_342.wav|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_343.wav|And we have the experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_344.wav|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_345.wav|This included a downward revision in the expected level of dividend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_346.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_347.wav|You just have to give yourself a chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_348.wav|They would be supported by visiting specialists.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_349.wav|You have caught a serial killer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_350.wav|I won't make an official complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_351.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_352.wav|I grew up with that in the amateur game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_353.wav|The move follows a review of the Singapore
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_354.wav|They make a selective perception process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_355.wav|Employees may be taken on at Livingston.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_356.wav|There is no quick fix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_357.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_358.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_359.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_360.wav|So what happens next ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_361.wav|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_362.wav|Walker plans to return indoors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_363.wav|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_364.wav|He worked there for six months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_365.wav|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_366.wav|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_367.wav|From there, they can go anywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_368.wav|I had relied on him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_369.wav|Truth is the child of time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_370.wav|The Reporter appears to have undue influence on the panel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_372.wav|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_373.wav|Brown has always protested his innocence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_374.wav|And the World Cup has not even begun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_375.wav|He remains a main board director of Royal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_376.wav|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_377.wav|Instead, he missed the lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_378.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_379.wav|Laura is an investment banker.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_380.wav|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_381.wav|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_382.wav|His background is firmly in venture capital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_383.wav|We played them off the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_384.wav|But the rally was short-lived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_385.wav|McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_386.wav|It must be tough to live with.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_387.wav|The statement contained no surprises.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_388.wav|Six other people were injured.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_389.wav|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_390.wav|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_391.wav|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_392.wav|They would have to go to the Royal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_393.wav|It didn't matter who was in their way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_394.wav|He ended up a headmaster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_395.wav|North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_396.wav|He is obviously very dangerous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_397.wav|The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_398.wav|That remains the unanswered question.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_399.wav|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_400.wav|It depends on Labour, not on us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_401.wav|It had so much to do with output.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_402.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_403.wav|After the match, do you ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_404.wav|Has the conflict started ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_405.wav|Have I really come to this ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_406.wav|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_407.wav|Its failure is no surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_408.wav|It has to be enforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_409.wav|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_410.wav|Those overseas offices were great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_411.wav|You will have seen the adverts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_412.wav|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_413.wav|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_414.wav|No plans for projects are yet in place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_415.wav|Three weeks later, he resigned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_416.wav|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_417.wav|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_418.wav|A, The media has been great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_419.wav|Everything has its place and purpose.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_420.wav|I have received no explanation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_421.wav|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_422.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_423.wav|You didn't need to pay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_424.wav|The might be rolled out.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_425.wav|But nothing could be done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_426.wav|They made such decisions in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_427.wav|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_428.wav|It seems a waste of talents.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_429.wav|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_430.wav|This would discourage investment and job creation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_431.wav|We have no information on Iraq.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_432.wav|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_433.wav|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_434.wav|The company declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_435.wav|It makes no difference to their friendship.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_436.wav|They make the right decisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_437.wav|I always savour the company of The Voice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_438.wav|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_439.wav|Today has been a good day for Northern Ireland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_440.wav|I got a yellow card.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_441.wav|It's an option, but I can't really comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_442.wav|Not many people like to do that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_443.wav|He now lives in Fenwick in Ayrshire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_444.wav|I might also completely change the routine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_445.wav|We accept the new rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_446.wav|He was due to retire in December.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_447.wav|We go there with confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_448.wav|They are interior designers and architects.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_449.wav|He was released after treatment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_450.wav|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_451.wav|When I was four years old I used to do like this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_452.wav|They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_453.wav|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_454.wav|They must play for each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_455.wav|We are aiming for early March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_456.wav|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_457.wav|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_458.wav|It will take place in July.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_459.wav|There's not much money in cycling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_460.wav|We will pay their bills.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_461.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_462.wav|It was very positive and very helpful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_463.wav|Now we see no mention of rising rates.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_464.wav|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p276/p276_465.wav|We are having a look.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.It's nice to hear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_025.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_026.wav|Is this accurate?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_027.wav|They have no history.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_028.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_029.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_030.wav|There's a story, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_031.wav|This is the window.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_032.wav|He was jailed for five years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_033.wav|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_034.wav|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_035.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_036.wav|Was it worth it?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_037.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_038.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_039.wav|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_040.wav|They're just different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_041.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_042.wav|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_043.wav|Indeed, he does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_044.wav|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_045.wav|He's just in it for himself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_046.wav|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_047.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_048.wav|We will push.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_049.wav|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_050.wav|This represents a tough game for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_051.wav|It is bizarre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_052.wav|They said she was stable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_053.wav|Is a drug dealer?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_054.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_055.wav|He is too weak to move.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_056.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_057.wav|He looks like an Afghan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_058.wav|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_059.wav|Here's a clue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_060.wav|It had been in place since last July.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_061.wav|Next league matches Celtic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_062.wav|There was no safety net.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_063.wav|It is unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_064.wav|That's the truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_065.wav|They are ready.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_066.wav|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_067.wav|I feel I did not have enough time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_068.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_069.wav|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_070.wav|They are real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_071.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_072.wav|That was a gold medal for certain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_073.wav|He was popular.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_074.wav|But I've won both ways.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_075.wav|There was an e-mail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_076.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_077.wav|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_078.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_079.wav|I had my suspicions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_080.wav|He was at home with his pals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_081.wav|It was magic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_082.wav|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_083.wav|It is a job creation scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_084.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_085.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_086.wav|Today she has been released.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_087.wav|He is in the queue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_088.wav|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_089.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_090.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_091.wav|Someone who cares
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_092.wav|By then, he was walking on water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_093.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_094.wav|It is a blow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_095.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_096.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_097.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_098.wav|Today I couldn't run on it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_099.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_100.wav|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_101.wav|It was clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_102.wav|It is annoying.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_103.wav|But I was wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_104.wav|I love the Dome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_105.wav|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_106.wav|Our position remains unchanged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_107.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_108.wav|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_109.wav|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_110.wav|You should be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_111.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_112.wav|Two of the team became ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_113.wav|He takes the job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_114.wav|She reflects a bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_115.wav|I am just trying to do my job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_116.wav|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_117.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_118.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_119.wav|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_120.wav|It is so sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_121.wav|The mood is upbeat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_122.wav|It is rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_123.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_124.wav|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_125.wav|Who would have?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_126.wav|There were no grounds for his action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_127.wav|I can't even get into the A team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_128.wav|I'm so angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_129.wav|She really suffered for her art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_130.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_131.wav|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_132.wav|No production was achieved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_133.wav|The BBC was a disgrace.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_134.wav|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_135.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_136.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_137.wav|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_138.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_139.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_140.wav|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_141.wav|I had decided to quit the show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_142.wav|We want to keep the pound.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_143.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_144.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_145.wav|Who would be right?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_146.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_147.wav|He realises his mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_148.wav|The role of the law lords would be retained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_149.wav|It is not just about pay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_150.wav|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_151.wav|So I got a blood test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_152.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_153.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_154.wav|I was so nervous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_155.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_156.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_157.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_158.wav|We are on a four-year mission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_159.wav|They should come clean.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_160.wav|My Dad is a hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_161.wav|He can do no wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_162.wav|Well, he should know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_163.wav|It is so unfair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_164.wav|I will tell you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_165.wav|I've put my own money into this project.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_166.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_167.wav|It is not like us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_168.wav|We've all had the shots.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_169.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_170.wav|Again, we were lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_171.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_172.wav|Does that put pressure on us?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_173.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_174.wav|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_175.wav|As we worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_176.wav|Tony had arrived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_177.wav|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_178.wav|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_179.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_180.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_181.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_182.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_183.wav|Our team is just so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_184.wav|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_185.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_186.wav|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_187.wav|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_188.wav|Peace was won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_189.wav|It's a fact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_190.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_191.wav|We believe a third party was involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_192.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_193.wav|Tommy is not a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_194.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_195.wav|But she might be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_196.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_197.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_198.wav|They make a selective perception process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_199.wav|We have an election in eight days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_200.wav|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_201.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_202.wav|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_203.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_204.wav|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_205.wav|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_206.wav|In each case they were a goal down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_207.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_208.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_209.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_210.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_211.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_212.wav|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_213.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_214.wav|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_215.wav|It's not before time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_216.wav|The report is due out next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_217.wav|But she was.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_218.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_219.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_220.wav|They must do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_221.wav|Dewar was certainly under attack from within his own party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_222.wav|However, no further action was taken by police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_223.wav|Until they came to do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_224.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_225.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_226.wav|There is no excuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_228.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_229.wav|But it's a subtle process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_230.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_231.wav|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_232.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_233.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_234.wav|It is hard won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_235.wav|Our policy is clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_236.wav|The scene is about this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_237.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_238.wav|There wasn't a goal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_239.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_240.wav|There's the mix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_241.wav|The concerns are the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_242.wav|I can't get a job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_243.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_244.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_245.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_246.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_248.wav|Is that a serious question?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_249.wav|This is the first step.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_250.wav|They must play for each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_251.wav|Souter will be back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_252.wav|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_253.wav|Blood samples were taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_254.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_255.wav|We shall rely on human beings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_256.wav|This is a question of Islam.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_257.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_258.wav|Immediate action must be taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_259.wav|It's very nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_260.wav|He was also married with two children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_261.wav|The system can work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_262.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_263.wav|We're in shock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_264.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_265.wav|It's a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_266.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_267.wav|It was very fast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_268.wav|The record companies have gone through the floor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_269.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_270.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_271.wav|If not, he should go home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_272.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_273.wav|He looked very sharp.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_274.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_275.wav|All options are open.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_276.wav|Dialogue is the key.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_277.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_278.wav|It was a virus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_279.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_280.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_281.wav|This is a national crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_282.wav|It was good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_283.wav|Who did the recruiting?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_284.wav|Bombing slaughter rejected
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_285.wav|The songs are just so good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_286.wav|The goals will come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_287.wav|There's a pause.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_288.wav|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_289.wav|I was the sheep.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_290.wav|What has altered?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_291.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_292.wav|Nothing is safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_293.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_294.wav|One was a lawyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_295.wav|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_296.wav|They are wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_297.wav|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_298.wav|The plot is minimal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_299.wav|You are the glory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_300.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_301.wav|The letters are going out today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_302.wav|We want to play at the worlds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_303.wav|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_304.wav|My whole life has changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_305.wav|We are a peaceful people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_306.wav|You may have a short memory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_307.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_308.wav|My body is clearly capable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_309.wav|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_310.wav|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_311.wav|A review is under way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_312.wav|It will work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_313.wav|I came into this world with nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_314.wav|It's too horrible to think.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_315.wav|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_316.wav|Off with their heads.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_317.wav|Is there a new way forward?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_318.wav|I was invited to work in Germany.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_319.wav|Is that an issue?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_320.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_321.wav|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_322.wav|The same things will happen with GM foods.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_323.wav|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_324.wav|It sounded as if it might well be tragic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_325.wav|Well, it won't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_326.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_327.wav|Two people were interviewed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_328.wav|I've got no secret.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_329.wav|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_330.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_331.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_332.wav|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_333.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_334.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_335.wav|He loves the big occasions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_336.wav|The performance was excellent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_337.wav|That has been lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_338.wav|Tell us about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_339.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_340.wav|She said they would appeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_341.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_342.wav|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_343.wav|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_344.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_346.wav|As, indeed, they would be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_347.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_348.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_349.wav|We will be homeless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_350.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_351.wav|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_352.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_353.wav|There was a substantial explosion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_354.wav|Not so, it seems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_355.wav|He could make it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_356.wav|Four policemen were wounded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_357.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_358.wav|It's now down in black and white.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_359.wav|Now, though, he has an incentive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_360.wav|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_361.wav|They have not done so this season so far.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_362.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_363.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_364.wav|So there, we won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_365.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_366.wav|There is no signature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_367.wav|It was a funny game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_368.wav|He was the architect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_369.wav|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_370.wav|I've never seen a game like it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_371.wav|I am a wealthy person.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_372.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_373.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_374.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_375.wav|Something is wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_376.wav|You can cope with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_377.wav|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_378.wav|That's the name of the game, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_379.wav|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_380.wav|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_381.wav|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_382.wav|At the last I found a bunker.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_383.wav|Yet the data is compelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_384.wav|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_385.wav|It's a real problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_386.wav|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_387.wav|I was in the train station overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_388.wav|It is unusual.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_389.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_390.wav|It's like a basketball.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_391.wav|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_392.wav|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_393.wav|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_394.wav|It was a kind of contempt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_395.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_396.wav|The car was just there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_397.wav|It will take place in July.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_398.wav|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_399.wav|Is that possible?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_400.wav|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_401.wav|What was the difference between them?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_402.wav|Emotions were complex.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_403.wav|Then , he laughs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_404.wav|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_405.wav|It is an absolute nonsense.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_406.wav|They recorded their debut album in New York.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_407.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_408.wav|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_409.wav|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_410.wav|Feel the air, the space.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_411.wav|He got his degree.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_412.wav|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_413.wav|went on sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_414.wav|But we finished the show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_415.wav|Mentally, you have to be tough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_416.wav|The people around me were fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_417.wav|I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_418.wav|It is legally binding.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_419.wav|Is there any prospect of this happening?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_420.wav|There's been a mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_421.wav|We just got a phone call on Saturday night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_422.wav|Eriksson would have approved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_423.wav|I am extremely cautious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_424.wav|It was little else.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_425.wav|It all began as an accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_426.wav|The MoD has denied any cover-up.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_427.wav|I know the worry over Iraq.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_428.wav|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_429.wav|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_430.wav|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_431.wav|We are all equal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_432.wav|It's been a long, long journey.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_433.wav|We were used.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_434.wav|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_435.wav|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_436.wav|They were not even allowed to see them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_437.wav|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_438.wav|Horses are drawn by ballot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_439.wav|It won the match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_440.wav|And it showed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_441.wav|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_442.wav|I hate the word.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_443.wav|Who would be in that desert?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_444.wav|I was lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_445.wav|The children are fine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_446.wav|They have to come up with a solution.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_447.wav|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_448.wav|The whole region is in shock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_449.wav|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_450.wav|It was a total disaster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_451.wav|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_452.wav|I got a yellow card.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_453.wav|Stewart was the life and soul of the party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_454.wav|Scotland has a dismal record of teenage pregnancy rates.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_455.wav|We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_456.wav|If they don't, they should say so.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_457.wav|It is a vicious circle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_458.wav|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_459.wav|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_460.wav|I'd love to be like Peter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_461.wav|I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_462.wav|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p277/p277_463.wav|The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_025.wav|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_026.wav|These decisions are not simple.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_027.wav|Life was like a timetable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_028.wav|She is employed on short-term contracts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_029.wav|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_030.wav|The director will be present.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_031.wav|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_032.wav|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_033.wav|It carried a double message.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_034.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_035.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_036.wav|Several investments have already been made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_037.wav|It was a hell of a way to lose.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_038.wav|Among them are many criminals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_039.wav|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_040.wav|This will get their attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_041.wav|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_042.wav|Well, the climate has changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_043.wav|Must be prepared to use it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_044.wav|He looks like an Afghan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_045.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_046.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_047.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_048.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_049.wav|He will need that machine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_050.wav|I have learned from him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_051.wav|I had trouble with the producers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_052.wav|He also presented You Bet!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_053.wav|People come to see the Highlands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_054.wav|They are to ensure information reaches as many members as possible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_055.wav|We have not given up hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_056.wav|She said she was really sorry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_057.wav|None has ever been found.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_058.wav|Let's hope that it does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_059.wav|The baby was later transferred to a hospital in Glasgow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_060.wav|It was exactly four months away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_061.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_062.wav|Only water is currently allowed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_063.wav|I'm looking to the future.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_064.wav|But it has been an amazing experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_065.wav|The judge was really nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_066.wav|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_067.wav|The fans would love it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_068.wav|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_069.wav|The party is up for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_070.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_071.wav|It was a unanimous decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_072.wav|It's all going to clear the debt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_073.wav|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_074.wav|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_075.wav|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_076.wav|By then, he was walking on water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_077.wav|We have to offer value for money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_078.wav|It's so hard to shift.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_079.wav|Mr Smith declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_080.wav|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_081.wav|That was a great performance by the team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_082.wav|He said a change in legislation was long overdue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_083.wav|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_084.wav|Everyone had to play the game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_085.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_086.wav|It was clear on Thursday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_087.wav|It's not a holiday time for football players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_088.wav|But they must believe in themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_089.wav|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_090.wav|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_091.wav|Thomson is expected to manage the business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_092.wav|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_093.wav|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_094.wav|In the end we made too many errors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_095.wav|That time is not now, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_096.wav|We created so many chances.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_097.wav|Our house was very small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_098.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_099.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_100.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_101.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_102.wav|And does it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_103.wav|Are you from the rugby ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_104.wav|Had I heard ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_105.wav|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_106.wav|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_107.wav|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_108.wav|We have got a race.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_109.wav|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_110.wav|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_111.wav|He was jailed for a year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_112.wav|They almost achieved a draw.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_113.wav|Football is a passion for many.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_114.wav|I didn't think so either.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_115.wav|It was located on the remote control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_116.wav|Maybe this battle has been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_117.wav|That might help a bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_118.wav|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_119.wav|Ferguson will be a millionaire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_120.wav|You can spend money on housing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_121.wav|The hearing was due to continue today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_122.wav|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_123.wav|However, the problem is the timing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_124.wav|This is a frightening development.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_125.wav|Which can happen any time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_126.wav|It was not a finale he would want to remember.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_127.wav|We had another last Tuesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_128.wav|I didn't feel under any pressure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_129.wav|This should begin in October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_130.wav|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_131.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_132.wav|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_133.wav|That would open the gates of hell.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_134.wav|You've got to be vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_135.wav|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_136.wav|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_137.wav|Before it was an ordeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_138.wav|It will affect their work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_139.wav|I love the spectacle of cinema.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_140.wav|They could use a boost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_141.wav|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_142.wav|Anyone can do the sums.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_143.wav|Others are not so sure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_144.wav|I have always loved the countryside.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_145.wav|It was his job to check.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_146.wav|I haven't made any definite decisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_147.wav|There's always the next century.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_148.wav|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_149.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_150.wav|I prefer the clarity of the existing system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_151.wav|Nothing was meant by it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_152.wav|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_153.wav|Its loss was an economic catastrophe for the whole of Moray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_154.wav|It was by the numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_155.wav|I knew he was good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_156.wav|We will turn the corner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_157.wav|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_158.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_159.wav|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_160.wav|The strong performance is expected to continue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_161.wav|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_162.wav|So was the first half.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_163.wav|It's never great to finish second.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_164.wav|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_165.wav|We have a budget in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_166.wav|He is keen to stay in public service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_167.wav|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_168.wav|US is the only country to vote against resolution.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_169.wav|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_170.wav|On my day I can beat anyone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_171.wav|We've made a couple of albums.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_172.wav|My life has been destroyed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_173.wav|What happened in that game ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_174.wav|Are you going to win ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_175.wav|Was it the wife ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_176.wav|Why change it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_177.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_178.wav|I always felt they played for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_179.wav|His team management was protective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_180.wav|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_181.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_182.wav|The outcome is now in our own hands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_183.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_184.wav|It is vital to clarify their role.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_185.wav|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_186.wav|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_187.wav|Says the Duke of York.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_188.wav|That's not fair to the supporters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_189.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_190.wav|I've always been like that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_191.wav|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_192.wav|They were seriously after him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_193.wav|But there's an upturn in the sector.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_194.wav|It shows the strength of the roots.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_195.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_196.wav|It caused a lot of upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_197.wav|However, this idea is never developed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_198.wav|I had come back from London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_199.wav|Last night was a key episode.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_200.wav|They are still very quiet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_201.wav|I wanted to put myself on the line.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_202.wav|I came home by ambulance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_203.wav|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_204.wav|It comes from reflection or thinking.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_205.wav|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_206.wav|We could soon be in that same position!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_207.wav|It was a horrible thing to happen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_208.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_209.wav|I am very realistic about these things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_210.wav|I won't make an official complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_211.wav|He is a good signing for Rangers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_212.wav|Bombing is the easy option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_213.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_214.wav|The move follows a review of the Singapore
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_215.wav|They make a selective perception process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_216.wav|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_217.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_218.wav|They have known the hard times.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_219.wav|It was important to win the singles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_220.wav|The only problem was the greens.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_221.wav|January is a bad time of year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_222.wav|His injury was completely random.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_223.wav|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_224.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_225.wav|I'm just a regular person.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_226.wav|My daughter is an adult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_227.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_228.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_229.wav|What are you not good at ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_230.wav|I think, therefore I am ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_231.wav|Who was she ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_232.wav|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_233.wav|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_234.wav|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_235.wav|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_236.wav|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_237.wav|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_238.wav|I have spoken to the skipper.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_239.wav|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_240.wav|The statement contained no surprises.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_241.wav|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_242.wav|This would include the GM food industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_243.wav|My wife and family are the support system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_244.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_245.wav|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_246.wav|I need a publishing deal!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_247.wav|It had so much to do with output.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_248.wav|A fatal accident inquiry will be held into the death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_249.wav|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_250.wav|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_251.wav|There were no reports of casualties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_252.wav|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_253.wav|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_254.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_255.wav|They made such decisions in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_256.wav|It seems a waste of talents.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_257.wav|I was just getting over the time difference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_258.wav|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_259.wav|You can feel at home in China.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_260.wav|We have no information on Iraq.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_262.wav|Paterson can afford to be generous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_263.wav|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_264.wav|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_265.wav|No production contract is yet in sight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_266.wav|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_267.wav|Messages have to be reinforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_268.wav|It is not enough to be first division champions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_269.wav|We accept the new rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_270.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_271.wav|was everything done to save people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_272.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_273.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_274.wav|Is it in the right place ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_275.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_276.wav|They are interior designers and architects.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_277.wav|He was released after treatment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_278.wav|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_279.wav|I'd never run for them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_280.wav|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_281.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_282.wav|These figures are truly terrible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_283.wav|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_284.wav|The stage was set for a showdown.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_285.wav|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_286.wav|I'd like to report a murder.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_287.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_288.wav|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_289.wav|Those overseas offices were great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_290.wav|I understand the security issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_291.wav|Truth is the child of time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_292.wav|It has become a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_293.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_294.wav|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_295.wav|It was never a free kick.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_296.wav|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_297.wav|This is a great opportunity for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_298.wav|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_299.wav|You have to expect this type of thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_300.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_301.wav|So the Government will be damaged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_302.wav|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_303.wav|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_304.wav|John was there already in spirit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_305.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_306.wav|I intended to look for another club on loan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_307.wav|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_308.wav|He will address the nation this evening.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_309.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_310.wav|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_311.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_312.wav|It's not covered by the insurance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_313.wav|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_314.wav|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_315.wav|You have to see it like this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_316.wav|You have asked for action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_317.wav|Holland won by five wickets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_318.wav|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_319.wav|The answer was in space.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_320.wav|It's unlikely to be renewed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_321.wav|I first met him last summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_322.wav|The songs are just so good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_323.wav|The casting is as perfect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_324.wav|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_325.wav|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_326.wav|McNaughton was not so sure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_327.wav|The dealer is on notice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_328.wav|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_329.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_330.wav|The party lasted all night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_331.wav|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_332.wav|Much the same thing happens in a young company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_333.wav|They come to enjoy themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_334.wav|That meant the search was unlawful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_335.wav|And he goes with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_336.wav|That reflected a tumble in banking shares across the board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_337.wav|We are on a four-year mission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_338.wav|The letters are going out today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_339.wav|We want to play at the worlds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_340.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_341.wav|How independent is that ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_342.wav|What form did that take ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_343.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_344.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_345.wav|The advisers had some discussions, but no conclusion was reached.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_346.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_347.wav|And he is immensely loyal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_348.wav|It looks as though the issue, with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_349.wav|Other musicians were found in retirement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_350.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_351.wav|And it was this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_352.wav|Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_353.wav|My view has now completely changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_354.wav|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_355.wav|He was at school in Devon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_356.wav|Finally came the moment of truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_357.wav|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_358.wav|A crucial moment has arrived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_359.wav|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_360.wav|Three years ago he would have been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_361.wav|But we welcome this document.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_362.wav|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_363.wav|His views are hardly surprising.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_364.wav|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_365.wav|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_366.wav|We put our bid in last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_367.wav|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_368.wav|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_369.wav|I was delighted to accept.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_370.wav|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_371.wav|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_372.wav|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_373.wav|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_374.wav|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_375.wav|He must have seen the movie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_376.wav|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_377.wav|The major championships will always have a special place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_378.wav|That is a break with tradition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_379.wav|This decision is a farce.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_380.wav|Is it worth it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_381.wav|Does it matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_382.wav|How do you take them away ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_383.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_384.wav|After the match, do you ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_385.wav|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_386.wav|In due course the deal was done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_387.wav|This remains the party's policy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_388.wav|They will fight for everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_389.wav|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_390.wav|The team hadn't been picked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_391.wav|One-third of the places are already taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_392.wav|I always knew she was funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_393.wav|The marshall at the turn was great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_394.wav|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_395.wav|They have not got anyone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_396.wav|The law would appear to be on our side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_397.wav|It has happened for generations.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_398.wav|The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_399.wav|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_400.wav|There's still no-one like him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_401.wav|They know it'll be fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_402.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_403.wav|Clark is back on top form.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_404.wav|I had a fortunate war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_405.wav|We must improve our relations with government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_406.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_407.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_408.wav|That is the ultimate revenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_409.wav|The next few months will tell.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p278/p278_410.wav|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_025.wav|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_026.wav|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_027.wav|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_028.wav|They should be so lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_029.wav|Is this accurate?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_030.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_031.wav|There's a story, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_032.wav|People love to see this stuff.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_033.wav|He took me on a tour of the wards.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_034.wav|Horses are drawn by ballot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_035.wav|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_036.wav|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_037.wav|They're just different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_038.wav|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_039.wav|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_040.wav|President Bush is at war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_041.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_042.wav|I was scared.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_043.wav|Dancing was her life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_044.wav|It will come all right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_045.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_046.wav|We will push.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_047.wav|That period was a struggle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_048.wav|It is urgent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_049.wav|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_050.wav|The judge said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_051.wav|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_052.wav|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_053.wav|It's a blessing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_054.wav|But it might have done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_055.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_056.wav|As she explains.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_057.wav|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_058.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_059.wav|Life is good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_060.wav|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_061.wav|Here's a clue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_062.wav|He had no enemies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_063.wav|Sadly, it can't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_064.wav|We have not given up hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_065.wav|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_066.wav|That's the truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_067.wav|They were too hard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_068.wav|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_069.wav|Art is extra.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_070.wav|They're appalled by that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_071.wav|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_072.wav|Scotland had great assets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_073.wav|He was popular.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_074.wav|Have a look at our accounts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_075.wav|It is like a river running by my home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_076.wav|The end result is precisely the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_077.wav|It seemed so personal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_078.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_079.wav|He had been a singer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_080.wav|I've been there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_081.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_082.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_083.wav|She died in hospital two hours later.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_084.wav|Is there a new way forward?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_085.wav|It works for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_086.wav|It is a time bomb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_087.wav|This is the way things should be handled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_088.wav|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_089.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_090.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_091.wav|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_092.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_093.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_094.wav|Yet, it worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_095.wav|This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_096.wav|It is an old family habit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_097.wav|Until you hit the big games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_098.wav|The peace process will be buried!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_099.wav|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_100.wav|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_101.wav|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_102.wav|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_103.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_104.wav|I see no need for change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_105.wav|That would be unlawful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_106.wav|I didn't play well last year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_107.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_108.wav|They will want to perform well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_109.wav|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_110.wav|I don't have many friends.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_111.wav|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_112.wav|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_113.wav|I was angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_114.wav|This is a step backwards.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_115.wav|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_116.wav|This film will be totally awesome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_117.wav|My office is bare.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_118.wav|Does this mean.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_119.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_120.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_121.wav|Who would have?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_122.wav|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_123.wav|We work on the same level.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_124.wav|You can spend money on housing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_125.wav|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_126.wav|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_127.wav|I'm so angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_128.wav|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_129.wav|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_130.wav|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_131.wav|Well, you can have a tree.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_132.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_133.wav|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_134.wav|It will be too hot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_135.wav|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_136.wav|I am now unemployed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_137.wav|You've got to be vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_138.wav|It's perfectly feasible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_139.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_140.wav|This represents a tough game for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_141.wav|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_142.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_143.wav|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_144.wav|Is that Titanic?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_145.wav|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_146.wav|It is like a football team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_147.wav|I am just trying to do my job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_148.wav|They did very well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_149.wav|You know the type.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_150.wav|In each case they were a goal down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_151.wav|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_152.wav|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_153.wav|It was the same at Twickenham.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_154.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_155.wav|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_156.wav|This latter point is hugely important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_157.wav|I am very happy with life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_158.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_159.wav|It is an attitude of mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_160.wav|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_161.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_162.wav|As, indeed, they would be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_163.wav|I have got a wife to feed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_164.wav|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_165.wav|Tell it like it was?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_166.wav|It is not too late to get on board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_167.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_168.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_169.wav|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_170.wav|Nobody did in those days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_171.wav|My life has been destroyed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_172.wav|His team management was protective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_173.wav|Is Saddam a threat?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_174.wav|We wanted it left for a wee while.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_175.wav|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_176.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_177.wav|The clarity is vital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_178.wav|The hotel was now for sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_179.wav|I drove the ball well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_180.wav|That has been the easy part.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_181.wav|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_182.wav|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_183.wav|Government will intervene.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_184.wav|We knew nothing about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_185.wav|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_186.wav|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_187.wav|It's a joke.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_188.wav|Does this matter?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_189.wav|It just came into my head that day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_190.wav|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_191.wav|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_192.wav|It is tough, but possible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_193.wav|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_194.wav|The procedure is the same in all cases.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_195.wav|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_196.wav|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_197.wav|It was typical.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_198.wav|Our strategy is straightforward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_199.wav|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_200.wav|I have a cold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_201.wav|Tommy is not a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_202.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_203.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_204.wav|He had suffered a heart attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_205.wav|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_206.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_207.wav|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_208.wav|There was no rescue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_209.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_210.wav|I don't want to use it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_211.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_212.wav|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_213.wav|The road was closed for several hours.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_214.wav|That is an important part of our role.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_215.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_216.wav|I am delighted for Simon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_217.wav|By hard work, is the answer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_218.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_219.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_220.wav|His death was a tragic accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_221.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_222.wav|He's a nice guy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_223.wav|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_224.wav|A career as a doctor is on hold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_225.wav|I am immensely sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_226.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_227.wav|It is a gamble.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_228.wav|My neighbours are horrified.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_229.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_230.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_231.wav|They are the innocent victims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_232.wav|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_233.wav|Broke the birdie record.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_234.wav|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_235.wav|It is set in Paris.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_236.wav|They should come forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_237.wav|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_238.wav|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_239.wav|You take a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_240.wav|It's too much work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_241.wav|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_242.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_243.wav|He will go a long way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_244.wav|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_245.wav|The scene is about this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_246.wav|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_247.wav|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_248.wav|He's a lovely young man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_249.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_250.wav|This year I understood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_251.wav|This is the culture change in medicine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_252.wav|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_253.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_254.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_255.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_256.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_257.wav|This is a big club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_258.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_259.wav|they fail to engage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_260.wav|People should not become complacent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_261.wav|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_262.wav|The warning is timely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_263.wav|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_264.wav|Blood samples were taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_265.wav|It looks as though he will be right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_266.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_267.wav|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_268.wav|It's very nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_269.wav|It left me with a sadness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_270.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_271.wav|It is the same in Sweden.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_272.wav|That could be in place by next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_273.wav|Things can change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_274.wav|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_275.wav|The script was funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_276.wav|They seem to get away with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_277.wav|She looked so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_278.wav|It happens from time to time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_279.wav|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_280.wav|They expect the minister to ensure that commitment is honoured.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_281.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_282.wav|I intended to look for another club on loan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_283.wav|You've got to have both sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_284.wav|The attacker died in the crash.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_285.wav|It was a virus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_286.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_287.wav|Who will perform?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_288.wav|It's like a high school play.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_289.wav|It was hopeless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_290.wav|I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_291.wav|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_292.wav|He wrote the letter two days before he died.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_293.wav|It changed my life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_294.wav|These figures are truly awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_295.wav|He should have won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_296.wav|Sunday's game was not a trial.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_297.wav|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_298.wav|What has altered?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_299.wav|Graeme was prepared.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_300.wav|I thought it was my only chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_301.wav|One was a lawyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_302.wav|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_303.wav|They are wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_304.wav|This is a war over our home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_305.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_306.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_307.wav|It was entirely justified.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_308.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_309.wav|It's certainly different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_310.wav|The letters are going out today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_311.wav|I did not name it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_312.wav|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_313.wav|Special measures were needed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_314.wav|It is all credit to them today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_315.wav|They were fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_316.wav|Craig is a major concern for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_317.wav|My body is clearly capable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_318.wav|I came into this world with nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_319.wav|The airport was even different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_320.wav|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_321.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_322.wav|He got the same story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_323.wav|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_324.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_325.wav|She did not attend the courtroom.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_326.wav|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_327.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_328.wav|Was this element always there?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_329.wav|They haven't got a hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_330.wav|He did a good job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_331.wav|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_332.wav|It is so unfair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_333.wav|It will be very, very tight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_334.wav|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_335.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_336.wav|The composer will conduct.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_337.wav|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_338.wav|Alex Ferguson is the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_339.wav|The boat was fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_340.wav|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_341.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_342.wav|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_343.wav|You need a licence to run a pub.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_344.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_345.wav|The salary changes are long overdue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_346.wav|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_347.wav|It is horrible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_348.wav|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_349.wav|I kept going for her.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_350.wav|He has seen the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_351.wav|Hartley should know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_352.wav|We are looking for perfection.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_353.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_354.wav|It's that sort of night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_355.wav|He could make it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_356.wav|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_357.wav|I lost my head.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_358.wav|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_359.wav|It was a double tragedy for the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_360.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_361.wav|Well, the big day has arrived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_362.wav|So there, we won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_363.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_364.wav|Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_365.wav|There is no signature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_366.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_367.wav|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_368.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_369.wav|He has the edge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_370.wav|Again, we were lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_371.wav|He denied the charge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_372.wav|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_373.wav|It has been a lovely family occasion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_374.wav|That's the name of the game, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_375.wav|YOU thought it was a headache.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_376.wav|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_377.wav|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_378.wav|It doesn't always work that way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_379.wav|I'm pleased about one thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_380.wav|We try to keep it right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_381.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_382.wav|It's like a basketball.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_383.wav|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_384.wav|I can lead by example.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_385.wav|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_386.wav|He is on the wrong side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_387.wav|It will probably take me just days to spend it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_388.wav|I was in jail for five years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_389.wav|It will take place in July.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_390.wav|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_391.wav|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_392.wav|I never won a penny throughout my career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_393.wav|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_394.wav|He's already made history.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_395.wav|So I did.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_396.wav|You ask the question.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_397.wav|Not because they want to sing about something.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_398.wav|You make the choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_399.wav|I have been in good form for the last two years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_400.wav|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_401.wav|Nobody even knew it had happened.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_402.wav|What would be the point?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_403.wav|The weekly average was three hours.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_404.wav|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_405.wav|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p279/p279_406.wav|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_025.wav|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_026.wav|His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_027.wav|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_028.wav|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_029.wav|The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_030.wav|She brought a lot to my life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_031.wav|Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_032.wav|Thomson and his family left court without comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_033.wav|I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_034.wav|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_035.wav|It is about control of our economy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_036.wav|Each brand was owned by a different family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_037.wav|That was not perfect golf by any means.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_038.wav|He added that her comments were noted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_039.wav|She will get through it I'm sure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_040.wav|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_041.wav|Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_042.wav|He does not even trust his own members.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_043.wav|He too started on the subs seats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_044.wav|Is it worth it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_045.wav|Does it matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_046.wav|How do you take them away ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_047.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_048.wav|After the match, do you ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_049.wav|Has the conflict started ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_050.wav|Have I really come to this ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_051.wav|I'm as fit as I can get.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_052.wav|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_053.wav|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_054.wav|The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_055.wav|Andy was a huge influence yet again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_056.wav|They seem too much of a sure thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_057.wav|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_058.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_059.wav|We just want this season to end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_060.wav|It was a day she thought she would never see.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_061.wav|Talks have continued at many different levels.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_062.wav|The referee is there to decide these things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_063.wav|There were no details of the other five victims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_064.wav|It also has a good labour supply.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_065.wav|Indeed he has a lot of output.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_066.wav|Do not give your details to anyone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_067.wav|He was failed by his health authority.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_068.wav|But it was not all bad news.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_069.wav|I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_070.wav|But during the bid process, that changed completely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_071.wav|It turned me against the whole system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_072.wav|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_073.wav|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_074.wav|But two groups refused to sign up.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_075.wav|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_076.wav|It had little effect on European equity markets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_077.wav|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_078.wav|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_079.wav|The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_080.wav|They said our costs were too high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_081.wav|I do not attempt to answer that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_082.wav|It's been a great evening for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_083.wav|That kind of growth is the important thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_084.wav|A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_085.wav|No plans for projects are yet in place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_086.wav|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_087.wav|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_088.wav|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_089.wav|I feel I did not have enough time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_090.wav|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_091.wav|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_092.wav|Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_093.wav|They had the appeal of TV stars.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_094.wav|There is no issue of national security involved here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_095.wav|He will be a very hard act to follow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_096.wav|Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_097.wav|Put simply, it goes something like this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_098.wav|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_099.wav|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_100.wav|I am delighted to hear this news.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_101.wav|We are already seeing some positive results.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_102.wav|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_103.wav|We were under a bit of pressure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_104.wav|They won't actually make any money from it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_105.wav|I bought a flat six years ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_106.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_107.wav|They are a different team at home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_108.wav|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_109.wav|Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_110.wav|Some young girls also came by last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_111.wav|Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_112.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_113.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_114.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_115.wav|So what happens next ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_116.wav|Had this been common practice ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_117.wav|What do they want us to do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_118.wav|The idea is the shop within a shop.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_119.wav|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_120.wav|It is the right package for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_121.wav|They have no real friends in the region.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_122.wav|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_123.wav|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_124.wav|In Glasgow, a sheriff dismissed five cases yesterday without hearing evidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_125.wav|I think there's not much between them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_126.wav|So I am going in the right direction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_127.wav|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_128.wav|We have to offer value for money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_129.wav|It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_130.wav|I could live without the attention, he admitted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_131.wav|He's got to look after himself now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_132.wav|He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_133.wav|No country has a similar training programme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_134.wav|There is no future in rock music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_135.wav|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_136.wav|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_137.wav|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_138.wav|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_139.wav|The programme has been made with great care.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_140.wav|There was only one living room, you see.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_141.wav|I am not under any new pressure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_142.wav|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_143.wav|It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_144.wav|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_145.wav|All eight victims were based in Germany.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_146.wav|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_147.wav|You should feel involved in their lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_148.wav|It is open season on the Old Firm.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_149.wav|Is it in the right place ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_150.wav|Did he trip ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_151.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_152.wav|Did it work ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_153.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_154.wav|Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_155.wav|Time may already have run out for this option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_156.wav|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_157.wav|When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_158.wav|They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_159.wav|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_160.wav|A progress report will be published in October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_161.wav|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_162.wav|That will reduce my chance of selection.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_163.wav|When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_164.wav|Surely it can't run for two years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_165.wav|But the game is still wide open.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_166.wav|It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_167.wav|However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_168.wav|I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_169.wav|We had to work very hard for our points.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_170.wav|That is a big risk at any price.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_171.wav|You need a long-term strategy in football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_172.wav|He said some things which were better left alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_173.wav|If successful, several records will be made.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_174.wav|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_175.wav|It didn't come as any great surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_176.wav|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_177.wav|It's just a different way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_178.wav|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_179.wav|Nato has left them with no other option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_180.wav|I am secure in my own position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_181.wav|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_182.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_183.wav|The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_184.wav|We have come a long way since then.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_185.wav|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_186.wav|A great player has to win major championships.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_187.wav|Highland health board has a responsibility here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_188.wav|I didn't miss the big house at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_189.wav|The story was not made public by this club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_190.wav|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_191.wav|You are not long home from work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_192.wav|I am fighting the force of nature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_193.wav|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_194.wav|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_195.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_196.wav|was everything done to save people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_197.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_198.wav|But they had to be paid for.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_199.wav|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_200.wav|The police insisted that they were standard issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_201.wav|One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_202.wav|I've never had a year like this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_203.wav|Full details are expected to be released in June.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_204.wav|As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_205.wav|Hague will be leader at the election after next.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_206.wav|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_207.wav|I want an answer from the British Government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_208.wav|Gas production was also at record levels last year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_209.wav|They are a victim of their own success.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_210.wav|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_211.wav|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_212.wav|It is going to change the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_213.wav|Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_214.wav|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_215.wav|The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_216.wav|I am not going to judge them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_217.wav|I do not see this so much as failure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_218.wav|A European final must be the millennium target.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_219.wav|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_220.wav|I was independent but I am not now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_221.wav|We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_222.wav|We are still seeking that complete performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_223.wav|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_224.wav|Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_225.wav|The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_226.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_227.wav|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_228.wav|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_229.wav|I want to see as much progress as possible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_230.wav|This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_231.wav|I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_232.wav|The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_233.wav|They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_234.wav|The labour side has developed in the North area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_235.wav|You are not allowed to do that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_236.wav|That is the last thing they need.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_237.wav|He has worked for several years in the United States.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_238.wav|The children were later able to leave by bus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_239.wav|Jim was down there with his wife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_240.wav|Was it the wife ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_241.wav|Why change it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_242.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_243.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_244.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_245.wav|What are you not good at ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_246.wav|I think, therefore I am ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_247.wav|Church leaders warned other homes could close.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_248.wav|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_249.wav|My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_250.wav|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_251.wav|However, the figures tell a different story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_252.wav|The rise has come too late for some.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_253.wav|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_254.wav|I'd rather play well next week than here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_255.wav|Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_256.wav|The British Government should follow the Irish example.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_257.wav|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_258.wav|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_259.wav|Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_260.wav|And they never show the same film as a rival.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_261.wav|Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_262.wav|There would be a north and south division.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_263.wav|The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_264.wav|The two companies were not for sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_265.wav|His condition was described as serious last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_266.wav|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_267.wav|The board do not own the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_268.wav|Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_269.wav|They always want to give a performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_270.wav|Its primary business channel is the internet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_271.wav|That's been the difference between the sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_272.wav|The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_273.wav|I think I was about four years old.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_274.wav|Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_275.wav|It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_276.wav|Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_277.wav|I think the shares are good value.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_278.wav|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_279.wav|Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_280.wav|The life office will now stay with Abbey.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_281.wav|Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_282.wav|Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_283.wav|He may be ready for first team action in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_284.wav|The fans pay for their season tickets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_285.wav|There was just fire all around me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_286.wav|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_287.wav|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_288.wav|No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_289.wav|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_290.wav|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_291.wav|He would get into any world team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_292.wav|Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_293.wav|They first met during a Step in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_294.wav|The agreement remains the only show in town.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_295.wav|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_296.wav|The strong performance is expected to continue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_297.wav|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_298.wav|It is based on population rather than need.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_299.wav|He could understand both points of view.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_300.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_301.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_302.wav|And does it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_303.wav|Are you from the rugby ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_304.wav|Had I heard ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_305.wav|What happened in that game ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_306.wav|Are you going to win ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_307.wav|It might have led to a screen career, but it didn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_308.wav|Further heavy charges are expected this year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_309.wav|It had happened on average once a week this year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_310.wav|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_311.wav|He is keen to stay in public service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_312.wav|Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_313.wav|For that reason cover should not be given.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_314.wav|He felt too close to head office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_315.wav|If you believe in the blue and white.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_316.wav|A report on their property is due within days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_317.wav|He will just go on doing his job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_318.wav|I always felt they played for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_319.wav|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_320.wav|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_321.wav|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_322.wav|We will not simply hit these people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_323.wav|We still think this trade is on the increase.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_324.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_325.wav|His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_326.wav|I feel as if I can hole everything now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_327.wav|I try to be open to experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_328.wav|He is not exactly a pretty child.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_329.wav|I thought the race was a little bit slow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_330.wav|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_331.wav|Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_332.wav|I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_333.wav|These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_334.wav|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_335.wav|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_336.wav|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_337.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_338.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_339.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_340.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_341.wav|Put another way, they just won't do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_342.wav|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_343.wav|Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_344.wav|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_345.wav|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_346.wav|It was a bit like having children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_347.wav|And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_348.wav|And that is the bottom line - box office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_349.wav|I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_350.wav|I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_351.wav|I think we are back on track.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_352.wav|Sales will begin by the end of October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_353.wav|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_354.wav|Friday night was a pretty good night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_355.wav|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_356.wav|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_357.wav|It is the only natural British site on the list.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_358.wav|His style was direct and very human.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_359.wav|Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_360.wav|They have the cash and the fire power.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_361.wav|The institute board will take the decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_362.wav|He's young enough and he must learn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_363.wav|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_364.wav|Both players gave so much to the side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_365.wav|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_366.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_367.wav|The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_368.wav|It was a goal which came from nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_369.wav|We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_370.wav|I have come here to show support for the families.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_371.wav|We have been going for three years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_372.wav|He really played us into a corner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_373.wav|They know the truth, they really know the truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_374.wav|It was another black day for Ayrshire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_375.wav|Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_376.wav|It used to be all hard sell.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_377.wav|The direct effects on trade will be limited.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_378.wav|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_379.wav|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_380.wav|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_381.wav|This is not a small amount of money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_382.wav|The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_383.wav|I just felt that I was broken down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_384.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_385.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_386.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_387.wav|The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_388.wav|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_389.wav|He remains a main board director of Royal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_390.wav|His record on Government has always been highly effective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_391.wav|My tax affairs have been totally open.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_392.wav|Five years ago its return was rejected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_393.wav|But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_394.wav|In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_395.wav|In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_396.wav|We are keen to see truth and justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_397.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_398.wav|People have a wish to charge twice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_399.wav|I think it's a big advantage to us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_400.wav|There were no hard words between us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_401.wav|Today he will meet the Italian press but he will give little away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_402.wav|Every blood test on sheep in Scotland has been completely clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_403.wav|These old songs are very nice to play.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_404.wav|My views on the decision are well known.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_405.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_406.wav|We were on top and could have won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_407.wav|Some would say that that culture had been created already.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_408.wav|So it looks like a done deal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_409.wav|The play was to go straight ahead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p280/p280_410.wav|At the core of these issues are real people with real jobs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_025.wav|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_026.wav|They are very clever in their use of words.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_027.wav|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_028.wav|Smoking is also very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_029.wav|It's not going to work out that way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_030.wav|They've got their own agenda.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_031.wav|I'd just like to play.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_032.wav|Our fans have been marvellous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_033.wav|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_034.wav|He should emerge as the winner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_035.wav|She failed in her action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_036.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_037.wav|It carried a double message.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_038.wav|It is a financial matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_039.wav|This film will be totally awesome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_040.wav|They want to be entertained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_041.wav|A week is a long time in politics.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_042.wav|I am just going to go for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_043.wav|There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_044.wav|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_045.wav|Among them are many criminals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_046.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_047.wav|He looks like an Afghan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_048.wav|That was the theory, anyway.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_049.wav|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_050.wav|I had come back from London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_051.wav|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_052.wav|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_053.wav|I must take a seat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_054.wav|That is very hard, alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_055.wav|The Government should be ashamed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_056.wav|None has ever been found.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_057.wav|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_058.wav|We should be able to cope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_059.wav|It was a lovely experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_060.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_061.wav|We will pay their bills.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_062.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_063.wav|The standard is extremely high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_064.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_065.wav|Only water is currently allowed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_066.wav|The tournament has now been cancelled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_067.wav|It is a real problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_068.wav|I have proved that in the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_069.wav|He had been a singer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_070.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_071.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_072.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_073.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_074.wav|The players will be down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_075.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_076.wav|There could be a lot of confusion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_077.wav|He also received a medal of honour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_078.wav|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_079.wav|Mini rugby is a great thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_080.wav|He is in the queue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_081.wav|I first met him last summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_082.wav|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_083.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_084.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_085.wav|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_086.wav|The error appeared in a warrant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_087.wav|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_088.wav|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_089.wav|IT is called a killing in the trade.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_090.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_091.wav|We could not get any possession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_092.wav|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_093.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_094.wav|The conclusion is the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_095.wav|It is a vicious circle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_096.wav|But I know the course.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_097.wav|We must stop it with the golf ball.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_098.wav|We live by the rule of law.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_099.wav|This is a national crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_100.wav|Otherwise, the market may come back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_101.wav|The following are the principal provisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_102.wav|Movement has to take place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_103.wav|City sentiment is in his favour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_104.wav|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_105.wav|It's not a lack of confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_106.wav|It was a funny game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_107.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_108.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_109.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_110.wav|That is the only way forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_111.wav|They are at a very early stage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_112.wav|The whole thing is the music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_113.wav|Or it would have been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_114.wav|His is a success story by any standard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_115.wav|Its replacement was not used in the exercise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_116.wav|Such actions are rarely popular.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_117.wav|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_118.wav|It is much as it has been described.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_119.wav|They've got to account for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_120.wav|Then again, we could have.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_121.wav|We have a training class.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_122.wav|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_123.wav|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_124.wav|It has removed a bit of guilt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_125.wav|She does not want to speak.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_126.wav|Scottish Life was there over one year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_127.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_128.wav|That is far too high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_129.wav|They made such decisions in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_130.wav|There were no serious injuries.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_131.wav|She was also very brave.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_132.wav|He wants to win a major.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_133.wav|First meeting was next week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_134.wav|I never wanted a legal battle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_135.wav|We will try to find someone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_136.wav|People come from all round the world to see it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_137.wav|We have seen a copy of the report.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_138.wav|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_139.wav|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_140.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_141.wav|It is not just about pay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_142.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_143.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_144.wav|I was caught out a little bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_145.wav|The FBI could become involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_146.wav|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_147.wav|Three hours later, the man was free.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_148.wav|We have a clean bill of health.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_149.wav|It is not normal practice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_150.wav|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_151.wav|The family kept away from me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_152.wav|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_153.wav|My Dad is a hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_154.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_155.wav|And does it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_156.wav|Are you from the rugby ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_157.wav|Had I heard ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_158.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_159.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_160.wav|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_161.wav|The strong pound also took its toll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_162.wav|It is a terrible tragedy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_163.wav|Shareholders may have to wait until June to be paid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_164.wav|I have got a wife to feed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_165.wav|We have a budget in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_166.wav|The pension levels will remain the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_167.wav|They will do their own thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_168.wav|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_169.wav|Our position remains the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_170.wav|It's nice to be nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_171.wav|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_172.wav|They could not match it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_173.wav|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_174.wav|Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_175.wav|One season, they might do well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_176.wav|You've got to be vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_177.wav|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_178.wav|I feel like my game has come a long way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_179.wav|The Hibs manager is no fool.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_180.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_181.wav|If that's the case, he will struggle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_182.wav|The hotel was now for sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_183.wav|I can't even get into the A team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_184.wav|They know no other way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_185.wav|The referee had a good game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_186.wav|I am not ready to walk away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_187.wav|Says the Duke of York.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_188.wav|The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_189.wav|Our destiny is in our own hands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_190.wav|He prefers to play for them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_191.wav|I have accepted the challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_192.wav|You know the sort of thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_193.wav|They were seriously after him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_194.wav|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_195.wav|And this game is all about belief.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_196.wav|Aberdeen had little to offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_197.wav|That would be my view.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_198.wav|It decided to blame the media.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_199.wav|We always felt we could win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_200.wav|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_201.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_202.wav|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_203.wav|Because he was born in England.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_204.wav|There was no way back for United after that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_205.wav|It was a test in itself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_206.wav|No details of the talks were given.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_207.wav|This will be our new beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_208.wav|They have the cash and the fire power.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_209.wav|We believe a third party was involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_210.wav|Tommy is not a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_211.wav|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_212.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_213.wav|This is a holy place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_214.wav|He had suffered a heart attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_215.wav|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_216.wav|You have caught a serial killer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_217.wav|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_218.wav|You are a great player.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_219.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_220.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_221.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_222.wav|What are you not good at ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_223.wav|You have got to look at speed of response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_224.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_225.wav|We're very unhappy about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_226.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_227.wav|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_228.wav|I had relied on him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_229.wav|I'm just a regular person.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_230.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_231.wav|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_232.wav|I am considered a teenager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_233.wav|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_234.wav|This will secure the future of our industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_235.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_236.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_237.wav|It was a crazy day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_238.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_239.wav|That has been the easy part.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_240.wav|You could feel the heat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_241.wav|We played them off the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_242.wav|After that nothing could save him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_243.wav|This is the year of the Tiger.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_244.wav|Wilson will tell the truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_245.wav|She died in middle age.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_246.wav|We just had a go.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_247.wav|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_248.wav|It is set in Paris.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_249.wav|He has run a hell of a race.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_250.wav|That is still in place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_251.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_252.wav|The irony was not lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_253.wav|The pig industry is on its knees.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_254.wav|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_255.wav|The minister is the engineer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_256.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_257.wav|She took them for a term.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_258.wav|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_259.wav|You can never tell with the manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_260.wav|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_261.wav|Persuaded to change his mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_262.wav|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_263.wav|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_264.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_265.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_266.wav|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_267.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_268.wav|That would depend on the parole board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_269.wav|The capital costs are modest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_270.wav|That could be in place by next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_271.wav|On the contrary they stand to gain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_272.wav|He looked like a schoolboy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_273.wav|England could only play the other team on the park.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_274.wav|He took over our lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_275.wav|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_276.wav|We feel very good about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_277.wav|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_278.wav|For him then it's a labour of love.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_279.wav|We are aiming for early March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_280.wav|It is also very valuable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_281.wav|The demand is created by the supply.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_282.wav|Not many companies can say that these days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_283.wav|I realised I was lucky to have it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_284.wav|That view has not altered.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_285.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_286.wav|was everything done to save people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_287.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_288.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_289.wav|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_290.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_291.wav|He was also married with two children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_292.wav|The target is to break even by Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_293.wav|You have to expect this type of thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_294.wav|They seem to get away with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_295.wav|We have to be very, very careful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_296.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_297.wav|It is a symbolic concert.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_298.wav|Hopefully, this week will be good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_299.wav|This is the correct decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_300.wav|He added that the business was in good shape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_301.wav|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_302.wav|Scotch beef is badly missed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_303.wav|The rescue package is public money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_304.wav|We are not doing the Today programme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_305.wav|There should be room for creative dissent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_306.wav|These figures are truly awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_307.wav|We need to increase the membership.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_308.wav|The real issue is personal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_309.wav|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_310.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_311.wav|He was at home with his pals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_312.wav|The dealer is on notice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_313.wav|The party lasted all night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_314.wav|We are in the end game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_315.wav|They come to enjoy themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_316.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_317.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_318.wav|That meant the search was unlawful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_319.wav|This may be perfectly innocent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_320.wav|Scotland has shown the way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_321.wav|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_322.wav|The letters are going out today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_323.wav|I can see their argument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_324.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_325.wav|It is all credit to them today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_326.wav|The whole family was in shock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_327.wav|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_328.wav|The actor has met with Mandela.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_329.wav|There is no shortage of farmers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_330.wav|It's difficult to predict the future.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_331.wav|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_332.wav|But the Farmer is bemused.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_333.wav|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_334.wav|However, the groups denied the claims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_335.wav|The airport was even different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_336.wav|There was no time scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_337.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_338.wav|Did it work ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_339.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_340.wav|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_341.wav|It's just the way I play.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_342.wav|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_343.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_344.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_345.wav|I have a moral dilemma.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_346.wav|It was almost too much.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_347.wav|It will now be unveiled in the US in July.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_348.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_349.wav|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_350.wav|He did a good job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_351.wav|It's a policy which has worked for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_352.wav|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_353.wav|I think this proposal is excellent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_354.wav|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_355.wav|He deserves a top team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_356.wav|It is all about having physical evidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_357.wav|It should be a great game, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_358.wav|I said she was very young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_359.wav|He had no previous convictions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_360.wav|Alex Ferguson is the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_361.wav|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_362.wav|Neither woman has been named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_363.wav|They should take their mobile phones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_364.wav|You need a licence to run a pub.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_365.wav|I got a yellow card.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_366.wav|There will be no final dividend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_367.wav|I believe the gap is nearly there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_368.wav|The major championships will always have a special place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_369.wav|She said they would appeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_370.wav|They were to blame for the first two goals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_371.wav|There is no deal as yet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_372.wav|It's as wide as a church in here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_373.wav|The shares are a strong hold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_374.wav|It would be quite nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_375.wav|There was a thing in front of the camera.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_376.wav|The pair are very much in love.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_377.wav|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_378.wav|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_379.wav|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_380.wav|I wanted to go out on a high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_381.wav|He has seen the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_382.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_383.wav|He has an equity stake in the investment house.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_384.wav|Our policy is very clear on this issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_385.wav|He has been a success this year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_386.wav|In fact, he was great today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_387.wav|Now, though, he has an incentive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_388.wav|A review is under way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_389.wav|It is a simple equation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_390.wav|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_391.wav|I was as strong as a horse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_392.wav|I had a fortunate war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_393.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_394.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_395.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_396.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_397.wav|That investment has now been secured.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_398.wav|He had returned to die.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_399.wav|It is hard to understand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_400.wav|Adventure is the champagne of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_401.wav|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_402.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_403.wav|The casualties were not named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_404.wav|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_405.wav|It had been on the cards.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_406.wav|He took a draw on his cigarette.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_407.wav|It was the same expression of joy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_408.wav|There is a solution, she believes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_409.wav|Yet the data is compelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_410.wav|That was a touch of class.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_411.wav|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_412.wav|That is a personal matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_413.wav|He seems to be used to the attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_414.wav|We will stand for the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_415.wav|Is it worth it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_416.wav|Does it matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_417.wav|How do you take them away ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_418.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_419.wav|After the match, do you ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_420.wav|I am delighted for them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_421.wav|Footballers have also been targeted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_422.wav|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_423.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_424.wav|My aim is a top six finish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_425.wav|That's the way it works.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_426.wav|The professor is in no doubt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_427.wav|It was a poor performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_428.wav|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_429.wav|John Daly has a burning ambition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_430.wav|Once again, they would be wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_431.wav|Together, we can make a difference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_432.wav|He will be judged by his actions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_433.wav|It is an absolute nonsense.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_434.wav|We might be back next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_435.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_436.wav|Size is not the issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_437.wav|It was support as it should be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_438.wav|I didn't get to keep it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_439.wav|It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_440.wav|THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_441.wav|He deserves a second chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_442.wav|It is pretty bad news.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_443.wav|We just thought it would be kept under the carpet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_444.wav|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_445.wav|We just got a phone call on Saturday night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_446.wav|But we have built a platform for next season.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_447.wav|I was embarrassed by it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_448.wav|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_449.wav|She came to the Highland Show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_450.wav|Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_451.wav|We have the location, which is assured.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_452.wav|They were good years for him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_453.wav|We're all paying for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_454.wav|This is the stuff of live music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_455.wav|She has now been registered as disabled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_456.wav|We could hardly believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_457.wav|The men are very worried.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_458.wav|Both promotions come as no surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_459.wav|We are going through the process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p281/p281_460.wav|It must never be seen as second class.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_025.wav|But it failed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_026.wav|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_027.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_028.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_029.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_030.wav|This is the window.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_031.wav|He was jailed for five years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_032.wav|Help is needed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_033.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_034.wav|It is marvellous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_035.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_036.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_037.wav|They're just different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_038.wav|It was clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_039.wav|Indeed, he does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_040.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_041.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_042.wav|Dancing was her life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_043.wav|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_044.wav|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_045.wav|They want to be entertained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_046.wav|It's the only thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_047.wav|You had better believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_048.wav|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_049.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_050.wav|A neighbour said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_051.wav|It is bizarre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_052.wav|There is no reason at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_053.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_054.wav|Every aspect of our play was first class.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_055.wav|Our people are ready.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_056.wav|Here's a clue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_057.wav|I was lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_058.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_059.wav|My fitness was very poor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_060.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_061.wav|It is unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_062.wav|I expect a rapid response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_063.wav|It happened so quickly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_064.wav|That's the truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_065.wav|It seems to have worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_066.wav|This is the first step.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_067.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_068.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_069.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_070.wav|But I've won both ways.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_071.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_072.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_073.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_074.wav|It could take some time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_075.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_076.wav|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_077.wav|It is a job creation scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_078.wav|The party is up for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_079.wav|People must remain vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_080.wav|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_081.wav|What has changed?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_082.wav|I will miss him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_083.wav|He is in the queue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_084.wav|I first met him last summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_085.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_086.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_087.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_088.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_089.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_090.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_091.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_092.wav|We are on the path of change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_093.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_094.wav|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_095.wav|Yet, it worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_096.wav|He's been hit by it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_097.wav|I love the Dome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_098.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_099.wav|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_100.wav|It is a love affair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_101.wav|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_102.wav|They make a selective perception process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_103.wav|Two of the team became ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_104.wav|That would be unlawful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_105.wav|I don't want to use it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_106.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_107.wav|It was an adventure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_108.wav|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_109.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_110.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_111.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_112.wav|Is that right?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_113.wav|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_114.wav|It's a shame.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_115.wav|It was the eighties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_116.wav|It is so sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_117.wav|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_118.wav|The mood is upbeat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_119.wav|It is rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_120.wav|Who would be a referee?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_121.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_122.wav|We enjoyed it today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_123.wav|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_124.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_125.wav|There were no grounds for his action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_126.wav|I'm so angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_127.wav|She really suffered for her art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_128.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_129.wav|It is not a U-turn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_130.wav|No production was achieved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_131.wav|I am now unemployed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_132.wav|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_133.wav|It plans to return to this field.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_134.wav|We work well together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_135.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_136.wav|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_137.wav|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_138.wav|I was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_139.wav|I don't know the full story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_140.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_141.wav|She died at her home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_142.wav|He realises his mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_143.wav|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_144.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_145.wav|I was awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_146.wav|Who would have?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_147.wav|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_148.wav|It is not just about pay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_149.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_150.wav|There was a substantial explosion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_151.wav|I was stunned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_152.wav|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_153.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_154.wav|They have not been named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_155.wav|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_156.wav|My Dad is a hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_157.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_158.wav|Words were not required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_159.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_160.wav|Life becomes a song.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_161.wav|Well, he should know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_162.wav|Was this element always there?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_163.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_164.wav|I'd love to be like Peter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_165.wav|I've put my own money into this project.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_166.wav|It has to be now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_167.wav|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_168.wav|I was in the train station overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_169.wav|We have a budget in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_170.wav|We should do everything at a stroke.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_171.wav|You had to go and see him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_172.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_173.wav|In a way he was.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_174.wav|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_175.wav|Blair's response was weak.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_176.wav|As we worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_177.wav|We are the gateway to justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_178.wav|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_179.wav|The goals were good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_180.wav|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_181.wav|It's an idea.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_182.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_183.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_184.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_185.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_186.wav|Does this matter?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_187.wav|Our team is just so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_188.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_189.wav|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_190.wav|It caused a lot of upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_191.wav|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_192.wav|We speak about the performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_193.wav|It is a farce.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_194.wav|Peace was won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_195.wav|It's a fact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_196.wav|I came home by ambulance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_197.wav|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_198.wav|Is that success?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_199.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_200.wav|Who will pay for this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_201.wav|It's all about money, money, money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_202.wav|Sadly, it can't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_203.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_204.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_205.wav|We have an election in eight days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_206.wav|Feel the heat?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_207.wav|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_208.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_209.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_210.wav|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_211.wav|Work has started.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_212.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_213.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_214.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_215.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_216.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_217.wav|Then another one came.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_218.wav|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_219.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_220.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_221.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_222.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_223.wav|It's not before time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_224.wav|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_225.wav|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_226.wav|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_227.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_228.wav|My wife and family are the support system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_229.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_230.wav|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_231.wav|We are so proud.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_232.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_233.wav|Of course I was tempted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_234.wav|It's quite a line-up!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_235.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_236.wav|The minister is the engineer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_237.wav|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_238.wav|It is hard won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_239.wav|Our policy is clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_240.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_241.wav|The scene is about this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_242.wav|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_243.wav|My son was too young to die.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_244.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_245.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_246.wav|It was a hit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_247.wav|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_248.wav|That could be in place by next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_249.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_250.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_251.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_252.wav|they fail to engage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_253.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_254.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_255.wav|They must play for each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_256.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_257.wav|There's not much money in cycling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_258.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_259.wav|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_260.wav|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_261.wav|He has not created a Festival resource.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_262.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_263.wav|He was also married with two children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_264.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_265.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_266.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_267.wav|One knows the feeling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_268.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_269.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_270.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_271.wav|She failed in her action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_272.wav|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_273.wav|She looked so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_274.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_275.wav|It's so awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_276.wav|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_277.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_278.wav|You've got to have both sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_279.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_280.wav|Dialogue is the key.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_281.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_282.wav|She is an expert on medical ethics.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_283.wav|Who will perform?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_284.wav|This is a national crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_285.wav|Who did the recruiting?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_286.wav|She is really magic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_287.wav|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_288.wav|I was the sheep.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_289.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_290.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_291.wav|Nothing is safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_292.wav|But it's a subtle process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_293.wav|One was a lawyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_294.wav|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_295.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_296.wav|They are wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_297.wav|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_298.wav|There were no passengers on board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_299.wav|It could work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_300.wav|This is a war over our home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_301.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_302.wav|There's no evidence he was ever there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_303.wav|You should be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_304.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_305.wav|The letters are going out today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_306.wav|Is there on his hands?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_307.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_308.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_309.wav|She is very distinctive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_310.wav|We have got to get the points from this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_311.wav|You may have a short memory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_312.wav|Henman has been warned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_313.wav|We are in the end game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_314.wav|It will work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_315.wav|I came into this world with nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_316.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_317.wav|Our message was inclusive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_318.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_319.wav|Feel the air, the space.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_320.wav|Is there a new way forward?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_321.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_322.wav|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_323.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_324.wav|However, they will only be found in the wild.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_325.wav|The same things will happen with GM foods.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_326.wav|Three years ago he would have been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_327.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_328.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_329.wav|Two people were interviewed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_330.wav|I've got no secret.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_331.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_332.wav|This is a friendly match?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_333.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_334.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_335.wav|They should take their mobile phones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_336.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_337.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_338.wav|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_339.wav|She is free.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_340.wav|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_341.wav|Tyson is overwhelmed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_342.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_343.wav|Yet he left a few days later.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_344.wav|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_345.wav|As, indeed, they would be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_346.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_347.wav|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_348.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_349.wav|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_350.wav|That would help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_351.wav|My husband was angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_352.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_353.wav|And he laughs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_354.wav|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_355.wav|This is a club on the rise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_356.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_357.wav|Their time has gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_358.wav|He could make it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_359.wav|The death rates are still as high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_360.wav|Now, though, he has an incentive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_361.wav|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_362.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_363.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_364.wav|It is a simple equation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_365.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_366.wav|It was a funny game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_367.wav|There wasn't a goal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_368.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_369.wav|Colour was at the core of his life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p282/p282_370.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_025.wav|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_026.wav|We are a service industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_027.wav|It's not going to work out that way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_028.wav|The idea is not new.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_029.wav|Because we do not need it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_030.wav|And we have a singer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_031.wav|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_032.wav|We speak about the performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_033.wav|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_034.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_035.wav|It could well be the case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_036.wav|It is not for any other purpose.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_037.wav|That means an extra two years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_038.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_039.wav|He is believed to live in Britain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_040.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_041.wav|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_042.wav|The boy is no longer with us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_043.wav|There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_044.wav|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_045.wav|Among them are many criminals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_046.wav|I was released after six days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_047.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_048.wav|Every aspect of our play was first class.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_049.wav|No details of the talks were given.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_050.wav|Clearly, they had other problems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_051.wav|It also opened a branch in Livingston.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_052.wav|I would say the position is open.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_053.wav|That was the theory, anyway.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_054.wav|I had come back from London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_055.wav|I was inspired by two things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_056.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_057.wav|There was no safety net.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_058.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_059.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_060.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_061.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_062.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_063.wav|He also presented You Bet!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_064.wav|Inspiring public confidence is crucial.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_065.wav|I expect a rapid response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_066.wav|We felt it was sufficient.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_067.wav|This is the year of the Tiger.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_068.wav|The motive for the shooting was not known.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_069.wav|We believe a third party was involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_070.wav|The Government should be ashamed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_071.wav|There's still plenty time left.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_072.wav|You do not change overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_073.wav|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_074.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_075.wav|We will pay their bills.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_076.wav|He is a young man with a new deal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_077.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_078.wav|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_079.wav|It is very special for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_080.wav|The tournament has now been cancelled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_081.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_082.wav|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_083.wav|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_084.wav|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_085.wav|The result is a vacuum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_086.wav|It looks like a hit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_087.wav|I'd like to see the business case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_088.wav|It makes for an interesting conference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_089.wav|I've had it for the exams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_090.wav|You have to respect the office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_091.wav|He has been a success this year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_092.wav|By then, he was walking on water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_093.wav|We have to offer value for money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_094.wav|It's so hard to shift.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_095.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_096.wav|Potions said he would drive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_097.wav|The trick is to try it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_098.wav|Little is known about them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_099.wav|However, it did not end that way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_100.wav|It really was an unusual award.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_101.wav|IT has been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_102.wav|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_103.wav|We could not get any possession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_104.wav|That is the important thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_105.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_106.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_107.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_108.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_109.wav|And does it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_110.wav|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_111.wav|It's good to have a voice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_112.wav|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_113.wav|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_114.wav|Their attitude is all wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_115.wav|We made a world record together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_116.wav|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_117.wav|It's for that reason he should resign.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_118.wav|There were no grounds for his action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_119.wav|It's been a long wait.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_120.wav|There is no credible official announcement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_121.wav|Our house was very small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_122.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_123.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_124.wav|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_125.wav|Sport is good for you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_126.wav|It was won on the issue of the land.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_127.wav|I am a committed European.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_128.wav|From it emerged a cup.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_129.wav|That was the first step.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_130.wav|That might help a bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_131.wav|It is a delight on every level.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_132.wav|We would make a start.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_133.wav|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_134.wav|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_135.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_136.wav|It does not even have a staff shortage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_137.wav|This should begin in October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_138.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_139.wav|We did what we had to do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_140.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_141.wav|But it is different in different regions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_142.wav|Last night, the row continued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_143.wav|You've got to be vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_144.wav|Glasgow is a friendly city.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_145.wav|We are entirely happy with Russell.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_146.wav|It's not a U-turn at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_147.wav|And I have some advice for my old friend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_148.wav|He was a home referee.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_149.wav|Before it was an ordeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_150.wav|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_151.wav|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_152.wav|I'm so grateful for that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_153.wav|It will be retained as part of the group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_154.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_155.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_156.wav|I am just trying to do my job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_157.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_158.wav|It has become a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_159.wav|I was caught out a little bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_160.wav|This will secure the future of our industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_161.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_162.wav|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_163.wav|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_164.wav|What happened in that game ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_165.wav|Are you going to win ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_166.wav|Was it the wife ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_167.wav|Why change it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_168.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_169.wav|It has to be an event.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_170.wav|Three hours later, the man was free.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_171.wav|We have a clean bill of health.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_172.wav|It was by the numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_173.wav|Today I had no failures in my team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_174.wav|My Dad is a hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_175.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_176.wav|He was asked to quit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_177.wav|There is no reason at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_178.wav|The woman was his wife.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_190.wav|Well, this article is a bit like that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_191.wav|It's nice to be nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_192.wav|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_193.wav|There was no hint of scandal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_194.wav|It was to be inclusive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_195.wav|I feel like my game has come a long way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_196.wav|The Hibs manager is no fool.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_200.wav|I'm just going to hit the shot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_201.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_202.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_203.wav|What are you not good at ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_204.wav|I think, therefore I am ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_205.wav|Who was she ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_206.wav|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_207.wav|They receive a high profile in the media.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_208.wav|They bought the property four years ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_209.wav|She was married with one son.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_211.wav|A copy of the report will be sent to the them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_212.wav|We are not making any comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_213.wav|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_214.wav|He lives in a neighbouring village.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_215.wav|It was a bit like having children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_216.wav|But there's an upturn in the sector.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_217.wav|I will work on her.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_221.wav|They are still very quiet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_222.wav|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_223.wav|I came home by ambulance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_224.wav|It comes from reflection or thinking.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_225.wav|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_226.wav|You could feel the heat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_227.wav|I suggest a new plan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_228.wav|That is the real test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_229.wav|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_230.wav|The early physical reports were clear.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_234.wav|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_235.wav|This will take several weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_236.wav|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_237.wav|We have an election in eight days.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_241.wav|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_242.wav|I had relied on him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_243.wav|I'm just a regular person.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_244.wav|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_245.wav|It was a great experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_246.wav|His second was a beauty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_247.wav|These will take a little time to develop.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_248.wav|There's a chance they might come down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_249.wav|This is an exciting time for the party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_250.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_251.wav|The problem was you thought you were a big man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_252.wav|It was a crazy day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_253.wav|A career as a doctor is on hold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_254.wav|Our future is in their hands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_255.wav|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_256.wav|It could be to do with the location.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_257.wav|We played them off the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_258.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_259.wav|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_260.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_261.wav|My wife and family are the support system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_262.wav|They have not been in touch with the club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_263.wav|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_264.wav|She claimed the day was for young people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_265.wav|It depends on Labour, not on us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_266.wav|It had so much to do with output.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_267.wav|She died in middle age.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_268.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_269.wav|was everything done to save people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_270.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_271.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_272.wav|Is it in the right place ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_273.wav|Did he trip ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_274.wav|That takes a lot of courage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_275.wav|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_276.wav|The irony was not lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_277.wav|I would do away with the dress code.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_278.wav|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_279.wav|The minister is the engineer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_280.wav|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_281.wav|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_282.wav|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_283.wav|Nato was not a love affair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_284.wav|You can never tell with the manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_285.wav|We need to establish the facts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_286.wav|Persuaded to change his mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_287.wav|There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_288.wav|Paterson can afford to be generous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_289.wav|My son was too young to die.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_290.wav|I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_291.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_292.wav|My office is down there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_293.wav|None of the agencies was able to help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_294.wav|I told you I was ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_295.wav|We accept the new rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_296.wav|He looked like a schoolboy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_297.wav|They are very keen to work with us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_298.wav|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_299.wav|The next month is very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_300.wav|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_301.wav|This is a total mystery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_302.wav|At first I thought I was gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_303.wav|It is the end of an adventure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_304.wav|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_305.wav|It looks as though he will be right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_306.wav|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_307.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_308.wav|The target is to break even by Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_309.wav|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_310.wav|My whole life has changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_311.wav|It was never a free kick.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_312.wav|It further expressed his defiance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_313.wav|He said he was sorry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_314.wav|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_315.wav|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_316.wav|We have to be very, very careful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_317.wav|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_318.wav|If not, he should go home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_319.wav|He is well respected by his colleagues.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_320.wav|Hopefully, this week will be good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_321.wav|This is the correct decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_322.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_323.wav|The Project is far from that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_324.wav|What form did that take ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_326.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_327.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_328.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_329.wav|So what happens next ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_330.wav|He will address the nation this evening.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_331.wav|The attacker died in the crash.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_332.wav|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_333.wav|No final decision has been taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_334.wav|In Europe, it is always over two games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_335.wav|I was there five months ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_336.wav|Well, he can do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_337.wav|The songs are just so good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_338.wav|And it's a goodbye from him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_339.wav|We need to increase the membership.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_340.wav|A new school will be built.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_341.wav|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_342.wav|The capital costs are modest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_343.wav|It became a book by itself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_344.wav|Cast Away now on general release.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_345.wav|Like many companies, it is a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_346.wav|The party lasted all night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_347.wav|But I think it's different from the rest!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_348.wav|It is a matter of clarity.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_349.wav|He did that every night I was with him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_350.wav|They come to enjoy themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_351.wav|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_352.wav|Another reason is a shortage of stock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_353.wav|And he goes with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_354.wav|My life is exactly the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_356.wav|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_357.wav|We want to play at the worlds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_358.wav|We will listen to any suggestion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_359.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_360.wav|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_361.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_362.wav|In the old days, it was easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_363.wav|They were impressive against France.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_364.wav|The airport was even different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_365.wav|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_366.wav|He was at school in Devon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_367.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_368.wav|I have a moral dilemma.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_369.wav|Last weekend he was awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_370.wav|There is a range of employers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_371.wav|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_372.wav|Ferguson is a good example.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_373.wav|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_374.wav|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_375.wav|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_376.wav|It should be a great game, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_377.wav|I said she was very young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_378.wav|He had no previous convictions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_379.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_380.wav|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_381.wav|Had this been common practice ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_382.wav|What do they want us to do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_383.wav|Is it worth it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_384.wav|Does it matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_385.wav|That can be good for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_386.wav|I believe the gap is nearly there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_387.wav|But the main issue will be the sale of Burger King.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_388.wav|They were to blame for the first two goals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_389.wav|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_390.wav|It's as wide as a church in here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_391.wav|It would be quite nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_392.wav|You must have a government and a good civil service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_393.wav|The pair are very much in love.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_394.wav|As, indeed, they would be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_395.wav|He has an equity stake in the investment house.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_396.wav|This is a club on the rise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_397.wav|We came across the first set of bodies.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_398.wav|Theatre is not a museum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_399.wav|It has only been rumours.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_400.wav|Final proposals will be published in February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_401.wav|I could not live with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_402.wav|The death rates are still as high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_403.wav|A review is under way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_404.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_405.wav|There is a lack of logic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_406.wav|That investment has now been secured.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_407.wav|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_408.wav|It proved a good decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_409.wav|Colour was at the core of his life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_410.wav|The BBC was a disgrace.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_411.wav|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_412.wav|But the foundations have been laid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_413.wav|I was Scottish on the basis of my family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_414.wav|I was shaking on the blocks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_415.wav|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_416.wav|I remain a buyer of the shares.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_417.wav|The second goal was superb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_418.wav|That's all I can say.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_419.wav|How do you take them away ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_420.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_421.wav|After the match, do you ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_422.wav|I am astonished at attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_423.wav|I was pleased with my own game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_424.wav|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_425.wav|Yet the data is compelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_426.wav|No date has been set for a meeting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_427.wav|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_428.wav|That is a personal matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_429.wav|I'm pleased about one thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_430.wav|My aim is a top six finish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_431.wav|These guys are looking for business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_432.wav|He is on the wrong side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_433.wav|I would rather look at him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_434.wav|It needs to be volatile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_435.wav|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_436.wav|It is based on a true story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_437.wav|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_438.wav|Being with me is an honour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_439.wav|He will be judged by his actions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_440.wav|Which may be the same thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_441.wav|We know about the crisis in cattle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_442.wav|We shall not forget him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_443.wav|I can almost pretend to be Scottish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_444.wav|Everything in golf is a balance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_445.wav|THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_446.wav|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_447.wav|Something has got to give.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_448.wav|Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_449.wav|If we were offered The Scotsman I would buy it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_450.wav|We went straight into the bedroom.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_451.wav|I do not see it as some kind of reward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_452.wav|But we have built a platform for next season.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_453.wav|I was embarrassed by it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_454.wav|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_455.wav|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_456.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_457.wav|I'd never run for them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_458.wav|She came to the Highland Show.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_459.wav|He was confronted by police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_460.wav|I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_461.wav|She has reached the top of her profession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_462.wav|Let that be their memorial.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_463.wav|This morning I got a call from my wife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_464.wav|She has now been registered as disabled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_465.wav|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_466.wav|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_467.wav|It all began as an accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_468.wav|We are going through the process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_469.wav|Ms Jackson was not present to put her case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_470.wav|City sentiment is in his favour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p283/p283_471.wav|It's been a long, long journey.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.It's nice to hear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_025.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_026.wav|We will be homeless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_027.wav|Is this accurate?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_028.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_029.wav|They have no history.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_030.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_031.wav|I'd just like to play.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_032.wav|There's a story, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_033.wav|This is the window.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_034.wav|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_035.wav|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_036.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_037.wav|It's a fact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_038.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_039.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_040.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_041.wav|Dancing was her life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_042.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_043.wav|We will push.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_044.wav|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_045.wav|Among them are many criminals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_046.wav|It is marvellous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_047.wav|Every aspect of our play was first class.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_048.wav|Our people are ready.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_049.wav|Here's a clue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_050.wav|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_051.wav|I was inspired by two things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_052.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_053.wav|My fitness was very poor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_054.wav|Sadly, it can't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_055.wav|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_056.wav|I expect a rapid response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_057.wav|What was the main difference?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_058.wav|There's a danger.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_059.wav|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_060.wav|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_061.wav|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_062.wav|It's that kind of place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_063.wav|They are real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_064.wav|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_065.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_066.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_067.wav|That was a gold medal for certain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_068.wav|We should have known.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_069.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_070.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_071.wav|He was at home with his pals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_072.wav|It was magic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_073.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_074.wav|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_075.wav|Is there a new way forward?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_076.wav|The party is up for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_077.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_078.wav|People must remain vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_079.wav|Today she has been released.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_080.wav|Who will pay for this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_081.wav|He had taken everything from me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_082.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_083.wav|By then, he was walking on water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_084.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_085.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_086.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_087.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_088.wav|It is a lifeline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_089.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_090.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_091.wav|She is an expert on medical ethics.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_092.wav|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_093.wav|Then came the crunch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_094.wav|It is annoying.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_095.wav|I love the Dome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_096.wav|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_097.wav|I am extremely sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_098.wav|It is a love affair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_099.wav|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_100.wav|May not have been at fault?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_101.wav|They tried to deny it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_102.wav|They make a selective perception process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_103.wav|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_104.wav|That's all right then.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_105.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_106.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_107.wav|She reflects a bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_108.wav|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_109.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_110.wav|It was a funny game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_111.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_112.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_113.wav|It was the eighties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_114.wav|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_115.wav|It is so sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_116.wav|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_117.wav|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_118.wav|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_119.wav|It is rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_120.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_121.wav|We enjoyed it today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_122.wav|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_123.wav|There were no grounds for his action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_124.wav|I can't even get into the A team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_125.wav|She really suffered for her art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_126.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_127.wav|The people will come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_128.wav|No production was achieved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_129.wav|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_130.wav|It plans to return to this field.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_131.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_132.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_133.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_134.wav|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_135.wav|I don't know the full story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_136.wav|It seems so long since I did the exams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_137.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_138.wav|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_139.wav|I was awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_140.wav|The idea is simple.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_141.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_142.wav|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_143.wav|It is not just about pay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_144.wav|Note the date.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_145.wav|So I got a blood test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_146.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_147.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_148.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_149.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_150.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_151.wav|I was on a roll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_152.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_153.wav|We are on a four-year mission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_154.wav|My Dad is a hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_155.wav|He was asked to quit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_156.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_157.wav|He can do no wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_158.wav|Was this element always there?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_159.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_160.wav|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_161.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_162.wav|They are not advertised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_163.wav|Seven people were later detained by police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_164.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_165.wav|Again, we were lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_166.wav|They will do their own thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_167.wav|Does that put pressure on us?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_168.wav|One season, they might do well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_169.wav|Is Saddam a threat?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_170.wav|As we worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_171.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_172.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_173.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_174.wav|I'm just going to hit the shot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_175.wav|Everyone can be bought.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_176.wav|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_177.wav|I've been there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_178.wav|Four policemen were wounded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_179.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_180.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_181.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_182.wav|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_183.wav|Our team is just so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_184.wav|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_185.wav|It is a farce.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_186.wav|Peace was won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_187.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_188.wav|I came home by ambulance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_189.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_190.wav|Is that success?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_191.wav|They are ready.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_192.wav|I have a cold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_193.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_194.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_195.wav|It's all about money, money, money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_196.wav|There was no safety net.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_197.wav|It was worth a photograph.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_198.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_199.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_200.wav|There was an e-mail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_201.wav|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_202.wav|I am delighted for Simon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_203.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_204.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_205.wav|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_206.wav|It's not ideal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_207.wav|In each case they were a goal down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_208.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_209.wav|I might come back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_210.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_211.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_212.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_213.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_214.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_215.wav|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_216.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_217.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_218.wav|It's not before time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_219.wav|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_220.wav|The report is due out next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_221.wav|But she was.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_222.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_223.wav|My wife and family are the support system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_224.wav|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_225.wav|We were awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_226.wav|They tried to give her advice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_227.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_228.wav|The parties have been given until today to respond.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_229.wav|There is no excuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_230.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_231.wav|But it's a subtle process.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_232.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_233.wav|The car was just there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_234.wav|The whole thing will be great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_235.wav|Our policy is clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_236.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_237.wav|You can feel at home in China.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_238.wav|The scene is about this?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_239.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_240.wav|It was a kind of contempt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_241.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_242.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_243.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_244.wav|It was a hit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_245.wav|There's the mix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_246.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_247.wav|Is there on his hands?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_248.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_249.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_250.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_251.wav|Chelsea was a great club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_252.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_253.wav|We have to expand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_254.wav|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_255.wav|Is that a serious question?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_256.wav|They must play for each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_257.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_258.wav|There's not much money in cycling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_259.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_260.wav|I am just trying to do my job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_261.wav|This is a question of Islam.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_262.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_263.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_264.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_265.wav|The system can work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_266.wav|We're in shock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_267.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_268.wav|It's a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_269.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_270.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_271.wav|They seem to get away with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_272.wav|She looked so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_273.wav|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_274.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_275.wav|If not, he should go home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_276.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_277.wav|We are a grandmother.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_278.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_279.wav|You feel very helpless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_280.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_281.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_282.wav|He will address the nation this evening.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_283.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_284.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_285.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_286.wav|This is a national crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_287.wav|Bombing slaughter rejected
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_288.wav|We are not going to forget.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_289.wav|No Briton has ever won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_290.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_291.wav|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_292.wav|The songs are just so good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_293.wav|And it's a goodbye from him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_294.wav|The goals will come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_295.wav|Who can predict?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_296.wav|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_297.wav|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_298.wav|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_299.wav|I was the sheep.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_300.wav|What has altered?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_301.wav|Nothing is safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_302.wav|One was a lawyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_303.wav|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_304.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_305.wav|They are wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_306.wav|I can live with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_307.wav|Work has started.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_308.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_309.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_310.wav|You should be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_311.wav|The minister is the engineer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_312.wav|The letters are going out today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_313.wav|We want to play at the worlds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_314.wav|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_315.wav|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_316.wav|Special measures were needed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_317.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_318.wav|The show is at an end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_319.wav|Your father was a good man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_320.wav|Such actions are rarely popular.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_321.wav|We have got to get the points from this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_322.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_323.wav|Henman has been warned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_324.wav|I would love it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_325.wav|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_326.wav|The problems began a long time ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_327.wav|For the moment, our position remains the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_328.wav|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_329.wav|We are in the end game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_330.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_331.wav|There was no time scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_332.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_333.wav|It is a job creation scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_334.wav|Relief was beyond belief.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_335.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_336.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_337.wav|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_338.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_339.wav|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_340.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_341.wav|He was the architect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_342.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_343.wav|He has to learn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_344.wav|Two people were interviewed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_345.wav|I've got no secret.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_346.wav|This is a big advantage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_347.wav|I'm very lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_348.wav|A great deal has been achieved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_349.wav|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_350.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_351.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_352.wav|They should take their mobile phones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_353.wav|Eight months later, he was dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_354.wav|I HAVE a dream.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_355.wav|We have big ideas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_356.wav|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_357.wav|I first met him last summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_358.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_359.wav|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_360.wav|She is free.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_361.wav|You must have a government and a good civil service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_362.wav|Yet he left a few days later.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_363.wav|The pair are very much in love.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_364.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_365.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_366.wav|Mentally, you have to be tough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_367.wav|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_368.wav|There was a substantial explosion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_369.wav|Their time has gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_370.wav|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_371.wav|They believed it worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_372.wav|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_373.wav|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_374.wav|Now, though, he has an incentive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_375.wav|They have not done so this season so far.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_376.wav|It is a simple equation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_377.wav|Clark is back on top form.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_378.wav|There is no signature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_379.wav|The task is enormous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_380.wav|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_381.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_382.wav|It is hard to understand.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_383.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_384.wav|I was lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_385.wav|Something is wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_386.wav|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_387.wav|That's the name of the game, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_388.wav|It's like a car crash.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_389.wav|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_390.wav|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_391.wav|You had to go and see him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_392.wav|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_393.wav|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_394.wav|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_395.wav|We try to keep it right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_396.wav|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_397.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_398.wav|It can help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_399.wav|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_400.wav|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_401.wav|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_402.wav|But we are a young side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_403.wav|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_404.wav|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_405.wav|It will take place in July.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_406.wav|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_407.wav|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_408.wav|It is full-scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_409.wav|Then , he laughs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_410.wav|You know the sort of thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_411.wav|I knew the script.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_412.wav|It might be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_413.wav|Feel the air, the space.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_414.wav|He scored a touchdown.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_415.wav|I believe the gap is nearly there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_416.wav|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_417.wav|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_418.wav|It is legally binding.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_419.wav|Is there any prospect of this happening?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_420.wav|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_421.wav|Eriksson would have approved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_422.wav|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_423.wav|It was little else.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_424.wav|He is to appeal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p284/p284_425.wav|Nato will prevail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_025.wav|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_026.wav|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_027.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_028.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_029.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_030.wav|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_031.wav|There's a story, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_032.wav|This is the window.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_033.wav|He was jailed for five years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_034.wav|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_035.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_036.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_037.wav|They're just different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_038.wav|It was clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_039.wav|Indeed, he does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_040.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_041.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_042.wav|Sure, it's funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_043.wav|This represents a tough game for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_044.wav|Is a drug dealer?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_045.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_046.wav|He looks like an Afghan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_047.wav|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_048.wav|Here's a clue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_049.wav|I was lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_050.wav|It's a miracle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_051.wav|I love the Dome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_052.wav|There was no safety net.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_053.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_054.wav|That's the truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_055.wav|We will treat it like a World Cup match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_056.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_057.wav|Scotland had great assets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_058.wav|It's that kind of place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_059.wav|They are real.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_060.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_061.wav|We should have known.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_062.wav|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_063.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_064.wav|The tournament has now been cancelled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_065.wav|There could be a way back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_066.wav|The death rates are still as high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_067.wav|I had my suspicions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_068.wav|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_069.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_070.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_071.wav|It's now down in black and white.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_072.wav|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_073.wav|What has changed?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_074.wav|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_075.wav|He is in the queue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_076.wav|He is driven.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_077.wav|All options are open.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_078.wav|I was too young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_079.wav|Someone who cares
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_080.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_081.wav|It is a blow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_082.wav|They lived for their children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_083.wav|It will be tight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_084.wav|This is the start of our season.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_085.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_086.wav|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_087.wav|We knew they could do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_088.wav|But I was wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_089.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_090.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_091.wav|I saw the whole thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_092.wav|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_093.wav|It was mayhem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_094.wav|Journalists should make him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_095.wav|It is a love affair.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_096.wav|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_097.wav|They tried to deny it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_098.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_099.wav|No, the equipment is extra.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_100.wav|We have an election in eight days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_101.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_102.wav|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_103.wav|She reflects a bit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_104.wav|It was an interesting thing to do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_105.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_106.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_107.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_108.wav|Is that right?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_109.wav|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_110.wav|It was the eighties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_111.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_112.wav|It is so sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_113.wav|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_114.wav|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_115.wav|It is rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_116.wav|Who would be a referee?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_117.wav|We enjoyed it today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_118.wav|She does not want to speak.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_119.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_120.wav|There were no grounds for his action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_121.wav|It has removed a bit of guilt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_122.wav|She really suffered for her art.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_123.wav|It is not a U-turn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_124.wav|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_125.wav|No production was achieved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_126.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_127.wav|I am now unemployed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_128.wav|We work well together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_129.wav|It's not true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_130.wav|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_131.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_132.wav|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_133.wav|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_134.wav|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_135.wav|It seems so long since I did the exams.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_136.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_137.wav|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_138.wav|Who would be right?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_139.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_140.wav|I was awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_141.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_142.wav|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_143.wav|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_144.wav|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_145.wav|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_146.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_147.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_148.wav|I was on a roll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_149.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_150.wav|We are on a four-year mission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_151.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_152.wav|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_153.wav|My Dad is a hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_154.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_155.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_156.wav|That includes the equipment?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_157.wav|Well, he should know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_158.wav|I will tell you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_159.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_160.wav|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_161.wav|As, indeed, they would be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_162.wav|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_163.wav|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_164.wav|They are not advertised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_165.wav|Tell it like it was?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_166.wav|Seven people were later detained by police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_167.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_168.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_169.wav|I carried on for him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_170.wav|He was a crazy man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_171.wav|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_172.wav|One season, they might do well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_173.wav|As we worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_174.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_175.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_176.wav|My players are special.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_177.wav|I drove the ball well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_178.wav|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_179.wav|The goals were good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_180.wav|His name was unknown.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_181.wav|Nothing is safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_182.wav|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_183.wav|Many innocent people will die.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_184.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_185.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_186.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_187.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_188.wav|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_189.wav|There is no openness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_190.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_191.wav|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_192.wav|It caused a lot of upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_193.wav|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_194.wav|It's a fact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_195.wav|I came home by ambulance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_196.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_197.wav|We live by the rule of law.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_198.wav|The service from the other players was super.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_199.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_200.wav|They've got three-quarters of the way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_201.wav|Today was first class.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_202.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_203.wav|I don't want to use it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_204.wav|There was an e-mail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_205.wav|He knows a lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_206.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_207.wav|It's not before time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_208.wav|It's not ideal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_209.wav|We want to keep the pound.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_210.wav|In each case they were a goal down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_211.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_212.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_213.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_214.wav|People should make their own decisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_215.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_216.wav|Because they didn't want to know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_217.wav|That has been the easy part.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_218.wav|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_219.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_220.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_221.wav|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_222.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_223.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_224.wav|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_225.wav|But she was.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_226.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_227.wav|My wife and family are the support system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_228.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_229.wav|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_230.wav|They tried to give her advice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_231.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_232.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_233.wav|Wealth is relative.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_234.wav|You should be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_235.wav|It's quite nice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_236.wav|Three weeks later, he resigned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_237.wav|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_238.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_239.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_240.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_241.wav|If we lose the doctor it would be the last straw.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_242.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_243.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_244.wav|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_245.wav|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_246.wav|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_247.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_248.wav|It was a hit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_249.wav|There's the mix.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_250.wav|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_251.wav|The concerns are the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_252.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_253.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_254.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_255.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_256.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_257.wav|Is that a serious question?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_258.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_259.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_260.wav|There's not much money in cycling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_261.wav|Souter will be back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_262.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_263.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_264.wav|He was also married with two children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_265.wav|The system can work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_266.wav|We are happy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_267.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_268.wav|We're in shock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_269.wav|Of course I was tempted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_270.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_271.wav|It was very fast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_272.wav|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_273.wav|They seem to get away with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_274.wav|I feel pretty good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_275.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_276.wav|She looked so young.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_277.wav|It's so awful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_278.wav|He looked very sharp.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_279.wav|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_280.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_281.wav|He will address the nation this evening.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_282.wav|Yet, it worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_283.wav|Who will perform?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_284.wav|It was good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_285.wav|Who did the recruiting?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_286.wav|We are not going to forget.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_287.wav|No Briton has ever won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_288.wav|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_289.wav|Who can predict?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_290.wav|There was a vacuum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_291.wav|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_292.wav|He was at home with his pals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_293.wav|What has altered?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_294.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_295.wav|She is really magic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_296.wav|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_297.wav|One was a lawyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_298.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_299.wav|They are wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_300.wav|It could work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_301.wav|This is a war over our home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_302.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_303.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_304.wav|It needs a team approach.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_305.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_306.wav|There is no excuse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_307.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_308.wav|The letters are going out today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_309.wav|She is very distinctive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_310.wav|We are a peaceful people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_311.wav|Hartley should know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_312.wav|Henman has been warned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_313.wav|Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_314.wav|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_315.wav|A review is under way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_316.wav|It will work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_317.wav|I came into this world with nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_318.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_319.wav|Off with their heads.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_320.wav|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_321.wav|There was no time scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_322.wav|Our message was inclusive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_323.wav|Either team will be hard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_324.wav|It's not long enough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_325.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_326.wav|He scored a touchdown.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_327.wav|The party is up for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_328.wav|The outcome is not in doubt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_329.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_330.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_331.wav|The same things will happen with GM foods.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_332.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_333.wav|Three years ago he would have been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_334.wav|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_335.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_336.wav|I've got no secret.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_337.wav|went on sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_338.wav|I'm very lucky.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_339.wav|Our policy is clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_340.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_341.wav|I will miss him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_342.wav|They should take their mobile phones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_343.wav|I got a yellow card.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_344.wav|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_345.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_346.wav|I HAVE a dream.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_347.wav|There may be reasons for it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_348.wav|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_349.wav|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_350.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_351.wav|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_352.wav|The pair are very much in love.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_353.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_354.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_355.wav|We will be homeless.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_356.wav|In fact, we were all over the shop.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_357.wav|It is a memorial.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_358.wav|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_359.wav|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_360.wav|This is a club on the rise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_361.wav|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_362.wav|They believed it worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_363.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_364.wav|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_365.wav|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_366.wav|It seems a long time ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_367.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_368.wav|So there, we won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_369.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_370.wav|There is no signature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_371.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_372.wav|It does not even have a staff shortage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_373.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_374.wav|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_375.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_376.wav|Something is wrong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_377.wav|It will be an exciting finale to the season without a doubt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_378.wav|You can cope with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_379.wav|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_380.wav|At the last I found a bunker.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_381.wav|It is the old story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_382.wav|Yet the data is compelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_383.wav|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_384.wav|It's just outrageous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_385.wav|They deserved the win.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_386.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_387.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_388.wav|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_389.wav|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_390.wav|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_391.wav|They are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_392.wav|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_393.wav|But we are a young side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_394.wav|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_395.wav|It will take place in July.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_396.wav|What happened in the summer?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_397.wav|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_398.wav|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_399.wav|Is that possible?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_400.wav|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_401.wav|What was the difference between them?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_402.wav|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p285/p285_403.wav|Emotions were complex.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_025.wav|Smoking is also very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_026.wav|We must convince the citizens.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_027.wav|I am pretty careful with money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_028.wav|Because we do not need it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_029.wav|It is about control of our economy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_030.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_031.wav|She is employed on short-term contracts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_032.wav|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_033.wav|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_034.wav|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_035.wav|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_036.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_037.wav|Costs have got to be controlled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_038.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_039.wav|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_040.wav|It is serious - but not that serious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_041.wav|Among them are many criminals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_042.wav|He looks like an Afghan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_043.wav|He will need that machine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_044.wav|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_045.wav|I had come back from London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_046.wav|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_047.wav|I had trouble with the producers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_048.wav|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_049.wav|We are certainly talking about many millions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_050.wav|We are a new department.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_051.wav|He also presented You Bet!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_052.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_053.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_054.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_055.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_056.wav|People come to see the Highlands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_057.wav|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_058.wav|We have not given up hope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_059.wav|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_060.wav|We would have concerns about suspension.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_061.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_062.wav|We have to keep our clients.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_063.wav|It seems to have worked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_064.wav|They have to come up with a solution.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_065.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_066.wav|It is a great feeling right now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_067.wav|It's not covered by the insurance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_068.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_069.wav|It wasn't possible to relax.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_070.wav|We speak about the performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_071.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_072.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_073.wav|That would be too easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_074.wav|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_075.wav|It is a job creation scheme.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_076.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_077.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_078.wav|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_079.wav|Their mandate is to target inflation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_080.wav|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_081.wav|It's all going to clear the debt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_082.wav|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_083.wav|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_084.wav|He has been a success this year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_085.wav|The error appeared in a warrant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_086.wav|We have to offer value for money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_087.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_088.wav|It's so hard to shift.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_089.wav|Potions said he would drive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_090.wav|Theatre is not a museum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_091.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_092.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_093.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_094.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_095.wav|And does it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_096.wav|Are you from the rugby ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_097.wav|Had I heard ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_098.wav|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_099.wav|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_100.wav|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_101.wav|It really was an unusual award.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_102.wav|I cannot believe this decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_103.wav|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_104.wav|Until you hit the big games.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_105.wav|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_106.wav|We will deal with the refugees.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_107.wav|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_108.wav|We could not get any possession.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_109.wav|They must be on commission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_110.wav|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_111.wav|It's not a holiday time for football players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_112.wav|He was forced to quit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_113.wav|But I know the course.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_114.wav|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_115.wav|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_116.wav|In the end we made too many errors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_117.wav|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_118.wav|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_119.wav|Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_120.wav|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_121.wav|It is an impressive record.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_122.wav|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_123.wav|I have learned from him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_124.wav|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_125.wav|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_126.wav|Maybe this battle has been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_127.wav|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_128.wav|It isn't a happy memory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_129.wav|The firm also has a construction division.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_130.wav|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_131.wav|Then again, we could have.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_132.wav|They will remember this victory for a while.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_133.wav|Structural changes were also required.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_134.wav|It was a good game to watch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_135.wav|His job was not advertised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_136.wav|However, the problem is the timing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_137.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_138.wav|Which can happen any time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_139.wav|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_140.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_141.wav|My life has changed a lot.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_142.wav|He said to give a local injection.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_143.wav|The manager's position was obviously included in that review.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_144.wav|The first half was depressing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_145.wav|Tiger is not the norm.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_146.wav|He will get his chances.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_147.wav|They could use a boost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_148.wav|What happened in that game ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_149.wav|Are you going to win ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_150.wav|Was it the wife ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_151.wav|Why change it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_152.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_153.wav|At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_154.wav|Anyone can do the sums.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_155.wav|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_156.wav|He's not a Celtic man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_157.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_158.wav|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_159.wav|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_160.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_161.wav|Behind him was his brother.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_162.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_163.wav|The family kept away from me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_164.wav|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_165.wav|We will turn the corner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_166.wav|My Dad is a hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_167.wav|It should never have happened.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_168.wav|We did what we had to do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_169.wav|The bank was now involved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_170.wav|Full back was a bit of the unknown.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_171.wav|It's never great to finish second.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_172.wav|Adventure is the champagne of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_173.wav|That would open the gates of hell.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_174.wav|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_175.wav|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_176.wav|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_177.wav|They could not match it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_178.wav|One season, they might do well.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_179.wav|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_180.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_181.wav|People should not become complacent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_182.wav|This championship is different from the other majors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_183.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_184.wav|I'm pretty happy with the way I played.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_185.wav|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_186.wav|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_187.wav|Each case is treated on merit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_188.wav|We have a long way to go this week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_189.wav|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_190.wav|His son is a local legend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_191.wav|Our destiny is in our own hands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_192.wav|They are only interested in attacking Labour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_193.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_194.wav|Miller was every bit as happy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_195.wav|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_196.wav|I cannot say too much about them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_197.wav|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_198.wav|The new owners wanted the club to go in a different direction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_199.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_200.wav|I'm interested in interesting work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_201.wav|We represent a wide range of society.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_202.wav|It caused a lot of upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_203.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_204.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_205.wav|What are you not good at ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_206.wav|I think, therefore I am ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_207.wav|Who was she ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_208.wav|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_209.wav|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_210.wav|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_211.wav|Mr Blair was ready for him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_212.wav|Because he was born in England.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_213.wav|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_214.wav|It comes from reflection or thinking.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_215.wav|It was a moment of madness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_216.wav|This will be our new beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_217.wav|They have the cash and the fire power.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_218.wav|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_219.wav|We should all be grateful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_220.wav|The early physical reports were clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_221.wav|The result is utterly compelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_222.wav|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_223.wav|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_224.wav|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_225.wav|This will take several weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_226.wav|Scotland will play its part.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_227.wav|The move follows a review of the Singapore
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_228.wav|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_229.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_230.wav|His injury was completely random.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_231.wav|And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_232.wav|It will affect their work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_233.wav|These things have not happened by accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_234.wav|They are difficult awards to decide.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_235.wav|I am considered a teenager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_236.wav|He must get to know himself.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_237.wav|There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_238.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_239.wav|Laura is an investment banker.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_240.wav|You could feel the heat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_241.wav|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_242.wav|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_243.wav|I have spoken to the skipper.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_244.wav|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_245.wav|The scientific debate is dead.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_246.wav|This would include the GM food industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_247.wav|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_248.wav|They are the innocent victims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_249.wav|She will attend in July.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_250.wav|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_251.wav|She claimed the day was for young people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_252.wav|Pensions are a long-term investment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_253.wav|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_254.wav|Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_255.wav|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_256.wav|Three weeks later, he resigned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_257.wav|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_258.wav|There were no reports of casualties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_259.wav|This fact is supported by audience research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_260.wav|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_261.wav|And it was this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_262.wav|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_263.wav|Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_264.wav|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_265.wav|We have no information on Iraq.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_266.wav|His is a global perspective.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_267.wav|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_268.wav|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_269.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_270.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_271.wav|No production contract is yet in sight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_272.wav|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_273.wav|The capital costs are modest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_274.wav|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_275.wav|This idea has been around for four years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_276.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_277.wav|was everything done to save people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_278.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_279.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_280.wav|Is it in the right place ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_281.wav|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_282.wav|That will be a problem for later.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_283.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_284.wav|They must play for each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_285.wav|These figures are truly terrible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_286.wav|Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_287.wav|There's not much money in cycling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_288.wav|The stage was set for a showdown.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_289.wav|It wasn't about one player.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_290.wav|That view has not altered.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_291.wav|Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_292.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_293.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_294.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_295.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_296.wav|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_297.wav|He's been here on numerous occasions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_298.wav|Further expansion has been achieved in Germany and Italy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_299.wav|That has been described in some quarters as nonsense and arrogance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_300.wav|You have to expect this type of thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_301.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_302.wav|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_303.wav|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_304.wav|The circumstances have changed since last year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_305.wav|I intended to look for another club on loan.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_306.wav|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_307.wav|It was simply no contest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_308.wav|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_309.wav|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_310.wav|But it has been an amazing experience.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_311.wav|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_312.wav|Our season is not finished.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_313.wav|The rescue package is public money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_314.wav|The effect was almost magical.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_315.wav|I was there five months ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_316.wav|I am a retailer by nature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_317.wav|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_318.wav|Holland won by five wickets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_319.wav|It's unlikely to be renewed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_320.wav|He has taken the title for the last two years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_321.wav|The songs are just so good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_322.wav|I must do something about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_323.wav|We need to increase the membership.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_324.wav|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_325.wav|They can go to no other method of fishing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_326.wav|You are a different people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_327.wav|McNaughton was not so sure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_328.wav|The dealer is on notice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_329.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_330.wav|It is a road of death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_331.wav|Investors can be forgiven for caution.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_332.wav|The party lasted all night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_333.wav|Much the same thing happens in a young company.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_334.wav|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_335.wav|Six other people were injured.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_336.wav|And he goes with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_337.wav|Survival is not an option.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_338.wav|The letters are going out today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_339.wav|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_340.wav|I didn't have the reply.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_341.wav|The actor has met with Mandela.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_342.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_343.wav|My body is clearly capable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_344.wav|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_345.wav|Other musicians were found in retirement.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_346.wav|It is a terrible state of affairs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_347.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_348.wav|Is our children learning ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_349.wav|What form did that take ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_350.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_351.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_352.wav|They were impressive against France.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_353.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_354.wav|It was a terrible combination of factors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_355.wav|Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_356.wav|Whether this return was too soon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_357.wav|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_358.wav|The pain is still acute.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_359.wav|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_360.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_361.wav|I have a moral dilemma.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_362.wav|My view has now completely changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_363.wav|We have very limited capacity.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_364.wav|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_365.wav|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_366.wav|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_367.wav|I think we'll just keep it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_368.wav|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_369.wav|Do not forget about Monaco.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_370.wav|You did not see it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_371.wav|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_372.wav|I was delighted to accept.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_373.wav|Neither woman has been named.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_374.wav|You need a licence to run a pub.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_375.wav|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_376.wav|Yesterday was a statement of intent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_377.wav|They were to blame for the first two goals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_378.wav|Finally came the moment of truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_379.wav|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_380.wav|It's as wide as a church in here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_381.wav|She is obviously very disappointed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_382.wav|It is not for any other purpose.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_383.wav|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_384.wav|The team hadn't been picked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_385.wav|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_386.wav|One-third of the places are already taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_387.wav|The marshall at the turn was great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_388.wav|That time may never be broken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_389.wav|The director will be present.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_390.wav|Rugby has an extended run.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_391.wav|Is it worth it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_392.wav|Does it matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_393.wav|How do you take them away ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_394.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_395.wav|After the match, do you ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_396.wav|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_397.wav|It gets into the culture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_398.wav|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_399.wav|In fact, he was great today.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_400.wav|A review is under way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_401.wav|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_402.wav|Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_403.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_404.wav|Well, the big day has arrived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_405.wav|Clark is back on top form.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_406.wav|The choice is strictly personal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_407.wav|It's too close to call.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_408.wav|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_409.wav|They were a lovely family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_410.wav|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_411.wav|I've had a wonderful career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_412.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_413.wav|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_414.wav|It's just a training thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_415.wav|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_416.wav|Three years ago he would have been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_417.wav|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_418.wav|But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_419.wav|It had been on the cards.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_420.wav|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_421.wav|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_422.wav|That was a touch of class.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_423.wav|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_424.wav|It was important to win the singles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_425.wav|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_426.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_427.wav|No date has been fixed for his return.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_428.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_429.wav|I never had a childhood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_430.wav|Nobody should believe this story.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_431.wav|It's going to be epic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_432.wav|They did the right thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_433.wav|There is another important factor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_434.wav|The growth potential is enormous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_435.wav|THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_436.wav|But he gave no details.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_437.wav|That was a great performance by the team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_438.wav|Which may be the same thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_439.wav|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_440.wav|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_441.wav|Everything in golf is a balance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_442.wav|It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_443.wav|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_444.wav|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_445.wav|There were no formal announcements.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_446.wav|He had no problems with discipline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_447.wav|Upgrading the station has been under consideration for some time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_448.wav|The couple had one daughter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_449.wav|National Farmer's Union of Scotland president Jim Walker welcomed the new proposals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_450.wav|We make this offer to the parliament.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_451.wav|The jury is still out.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_452.wav|No further details of expansion plans were given.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_453.wav|He was said to be emotionally disturbed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_454.wav|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_455.wav|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_456.wav|They were good years for him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_457.wav|It was his job to check.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_458.wav|The boys are mentally focused.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_459.wav|The damage has been done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_460.wav|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_461.wav|They are defined by law.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_462.wav|The peace process will be buried!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_463.wav|We are now up against it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_464.wav|Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_465.wav|It is vital to clarify their role.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_466.wav|He was backed by Downing Street.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_467.wav|It also indicated that her condition had deteriorated.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p286/p286_468.wav|You have to have a proven track record to get them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_025.wav|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_026.wav|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_027.wav|Meetings will also remain private.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_028.wav|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_029.wav|He has the courage of the unaware.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_030.wav|Life was like a timetable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_031.wav|This is a central issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_032.wav|But a solution has been found.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_033.wav|I thought it was an accident.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_034.wav|President Bush is at war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_035.wav|That period was a struggle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_036.wav|This represents a tough game for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_037.wav|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_038.wav|Among them are many criminals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_039.wav|But it might have done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_040.wav|There is no reason at all.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_041.wav|This will get their attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_042.wav|Must be prepared to use it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_043.wav|He will need that machine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_044.wav|I had come back from London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_045.wav|I saw them last week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_046.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_047.wav|There was no safety net.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_048.wav|The teacher would have approved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_049.wav|It is quite a figure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_050.wav|We have to look beyond the very short term.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_051.wav|It depends on the couple.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_052.wav|I expect a rapid response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_053.wav|The motive for the shooting was not known.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_054.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_055.wav|You do not change overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_056.wav|We will pay their bills.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_057.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_058.wav|How are you, sir ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_059.wav|So is that it, then ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_060.wav|Do I have a favourite ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_061.wav|What do we do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_062.wav|It has been an amazing day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_063.wav|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_064.wav|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_065.wav|This is a big step up.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_066.wav|There can be no compromise on welfare.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_067.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_068.wav|Now the plot is perfect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_069.wav|That would be too easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_070.wav|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_071.wav|It looks like a hit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_072.wav|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_073.wav|I first met him last summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_074.wav|We did it for the jersey.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_075.wav|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_076.wav|By then, he was walking on water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_077.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_078.wav|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_079.wav|That was a great performance by the team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_080.wav|It was a total disaster.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_081.wav|I've never seen anything like it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_082.wav|He added that he felt undermined.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_083.wav|It was not an insult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_084.wav|In each case they were a goal down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_085.wav|It was clear on Thursday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_086.wav|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_087.wav|FOR once, you should believe the hype.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_088.wav|But I know the course.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_089.wav|We intend to change the model.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_090.wav|Two of the team became ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_091.wav|No, the equipment is extra.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_092.wav|This decision is a farce.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_093.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_094.wav|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_095.wav|It would be the end of farming.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_096.wav|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_097.wav|It's not a lack of confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_098.wav|We have got a race.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_099.wav|He will go on the bench.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_100.wav|You had better believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_101.wav|New Year will be very busy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_102.wav|There's still plenty time left.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_103.wav|That was the first step.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_104.wav|I was impressed with them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_105.wav|Such actions are rarely popular.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_106.wav|Mr Blair should be warned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_107.wav|Why do it otherwise ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_108.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_109.wav|So, did she meet him ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_110.wav|So what is the campaign about ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_111.wav|And does it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_112.wav|Then again, we could have.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_113.wav|There were no grounds for his action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_114.wav|We have a training class.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_115.wav|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_116.wav|We did what we had to do.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_117.wav|They made such decisions in London.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_118.wav|She was also very brave.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_119.wav|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_120.wav|You are a gambling man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_121.wav|My conscience is not clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_122.wav|He is a great addition to our team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_123.wav|I felt he was excellent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_124.wav|We will try to find someone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_125.wav|The money needs to go to the front line.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_126.wav|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_127.wav|I miss the freedom that I had.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_128.wav|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_129.wav|We had to add value.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_130.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_131.wav|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_132.wav|That is the real test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_133.wav|I would relish the prospect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_134.wav|It has become a way of life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_135.wav|We will provide immediate access.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_136.wav|It will clearly be discussed in cabinet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_137.wav|Three hours later, the man was free.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_138.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_139.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_140.wav|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_141.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_142.wav|It would seem a natural progression.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_143.wav|We will turn the corner.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_144.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_145.wav|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_146.wav|The strong pound also took its toll.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_147.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_148.wav|I am a good player.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_149.wav|That shows the strength of the US Tour.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_150.wav|We have a budget in March.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_151.wav|The pension levels will remain the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_152.wav|You had to go and see him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_153.wav|They could not match it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_154.wav|The people are the hero.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_155.wav|Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_156.wav|The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_157.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_158.wav|This much I can tell you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_159.wav|The Hibs manager is no fool.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_160.wav|Phase one was a shambles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_161.wav|The hotel was now for sale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_162.wav|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_163.wav|Tomorrow is a new day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_164.wav|What happened in that game ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_165.wav|Are you going to win ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_166.wav|Was it the wife ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_167.wav|Why change it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_168.wav|What do we want to do that for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_169.wav|His son is a local legend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_170.wav|I am not ready to walk away.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_171.wav|Says the Duke of York.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_172.wav|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_173.wav|Our destiny is in our own hands.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_174.wav|They bought the property four years ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_175.wav|They need to look after themselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_176.wav|He is believed to live in Britain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_177.wav|People like to talk about these things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_178.wav|Being investor ready is a good start.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_179.wav|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_180.wav|We've had great things in the past.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_181.wav|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_182.wav|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_183.wav|You know the sort of thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_184.wav|They were seriously after him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_185.wav|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_186.wav|It was a pre-emptive strike.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_187.wav|It caused a lot of upset.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_188.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_189.wav|Last night was a key episode.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_190.wav|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_191.wav|It is hard to tell.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_192.wav|I can't play the game for them.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_193.wav|I was inspired by two things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_194.wav|They might be surprised by the response.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_195.wav|It comes from reflection or thinking.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_196.wav|This will be our new beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_197.wav|The service from the other players was super.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_198.wav|However, it is not as simple as this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_199.wav|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_200.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_201.wav|Getting this right is essential.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_202.wav|Does the name matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_203.wav|how do you get it back ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_204.wav|What are you not good at ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_205.wav|I think, therefore I am ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_206.wav|Who was she ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_207.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_208.wav|From there, they can go anywhere.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_209.wav|I had relied on him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_210.wav|We used to live with dignity in our country.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_211.wav|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_212.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_213.wav|His third goal was superb.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_214.wav|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_215.wav|His second was a beauty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_216.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_217.wav|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_218.wav|And the World Cup has not even begun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_219.wav|He remains a main board director of Royal.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_220.wav|The red card was okay.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_221.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_222.wav|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_223.wav|It will now take over the running of the estate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_224.wav|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_225.wav|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_226.wav|Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_227.wav|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_228.wav|We have learned a tremendous amount.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_229.wav|She died in middle age.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_230.wav|And thought we would get away with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_231.wav|We were a load of rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_232.wav|The trust was unable to pay the fourth interim dividend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_233.wav|This is a family club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_234.wav|They need to win a trophy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_235.wav|I was ready for this.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_236.wav|I am still waiting for a reply.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_237.wav|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_238.wav|My future is in the marathon.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_239.wav|The effects are not all bad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_240.wav|He would not impose a fine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_241.wav|It was a fairy tale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_242.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_243.wav|She took them for a term.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_244.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_245.wav|But that's another story for another day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_246.wav|On a practical level, it would be difficult.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_247.wav|Persuaded to change his mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_248.wav|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_249.wav|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_250.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_251.wav|I should think so, too.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_252.wav|It makes no difference to their friendship.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_253.wav|No production contract is yet in sight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_254.wav|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_255.wav|That you can do it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_256.wav|He was on a horse.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_257.wav|The concerns are the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_258.wav|We are in a war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_259.wav|It is not enough to be first division champions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_260.wav|We run within the law.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_261.wav|On the contrary they stand to gain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_262.wav|They are very keen to work with us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_263.wav|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_264.wav|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_265.wav|They must play for each other.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_266.wav|It is also very valuable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_267.wav|There's not much money in cycling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_268.wav|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_269.wav|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_270.wav|We're trying to get rounded performers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_271.wav|This is a question of Islam.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_272.wav|And they were being paid ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_273.wav|was everything done to save people ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_274.wav|What was the matter for concern ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_275.wav|Do I think about them often ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_276.wav|Is it in the right place ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_277.wav|Did he trip ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_278.wav|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_279.wav|Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_280.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_281.wav|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_282.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_283.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_284.wav|And Michael was just great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_285.wav|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_286.wav|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_287.wav|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_288.wav|It was never a free kick.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_289.wav|She failed in her action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_290.wav|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_291.wav|We have to be very, very careful.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_292.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_293.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_294.wav|If not, he should go home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_295.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_296.wav|Size is not the issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_297.wav|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_298.wav|But it is up again.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_299.wav|The rescue package is public money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_300.wav|Either team will be hard.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_301.wav|That is the general feeling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_302.wav|It has to be an event.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_303.wav|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_304.wav|We can work all night.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_305.wav|The answer is with ourselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_306.wav|Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott appealed for privacy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_307.wav|There is no evidence for that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_308.wav|I can hardly believe it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_309.wav|Nothing has been put into action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_310.wav|You are a different people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_311.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_312.wav|This will secure the future of our industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_313.wav|They are not left wing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_314.wav|McNaughton was not so sure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_315.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_316.wav|The City welcomed the numbers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_317.wav|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_318.wav|This is a war over our home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_319.wav|We have a good healthy debate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_320.wav|And he goes with it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_321.wav|I have signed a contract.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_322.wav|It is a court case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_323.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_324.wav|Leading share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_325.wav|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_326.wav|After some discussion they did.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_327.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_328.wav|It wasn't a good day for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_329.wav|The show is at an end.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_330.wav|What form did that take ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_331.wav|Are they free ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_332.wav|What are they for ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_333.wav|Is there a waiting list ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_334.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_335.wav|So what happens next ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_336.wav|It was an achievement all right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_337.wav|My whole life has changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_338.wav|We are a peaceful people.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_339.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_340.wav|You may have a short memory.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_341.wav|The problems began a long time ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_342.wav|A Home Office spokesman said.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_343.wav|In the old days, it was easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_344.wav|I think it's about time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_345.wav|The airport was even different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_346.wav|Other people had looked at it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_347.wav|They are now out in the cold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_348.wav|It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_349.wav|It is a strong case.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_350.wav|My view has now completely changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_351.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_352.wav|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_353.wav|It's wonderful to have won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_354.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_355.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_356.wav|Appointments should be made on merit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_357.wav|I have a moral dilemma.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_358.wav|Even the one she loved.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_359.wav|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_360.wav|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_361.wav|They were the acts of men.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_362.wav|This should include procedures for personal imports.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_363.wav|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_364.wav|Three years ago he would have been.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_365.wav|He did a good job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_366.wav|It's a policy which has worked for us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_367.wav|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_368.wav|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_369.wav|It is a stroke of genius.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_370.wav|The members have voted against it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_371.wav|We knew he was very creative.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_372.wav|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_373.wav|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_374.wav|They should take their mobile phones.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_375.wav|SE is well down that road.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_376.wav|The hill farm is owned by the father of the young man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_377.wav|There is a cup final at stake.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_378.wav|It's only a matter of scale.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_379.wav|I do not like to lose.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_380.wav|There is no deal as yet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_381.wav|It's as wide as a church in here.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_382.wav|This remains the party's policy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_383.wav|They will fight for everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_384.wav|The pair are very much in love.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_385.wav|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_386.wav|It was like a vacuum.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_387.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_388.wav|My dad is all right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_389.wav|It gets into the culture.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_390.wav|There was a substantial explosion.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_391.wav|But we are very near.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_392.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_393.wav|It has only been rumours.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_394.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_395.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_396.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_397.wav|Safety was also an issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_398.wav|Had this been common practice ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_399.wav|What do they want us to do ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_400.wav|Is it worth it ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_401.wav|Does it matter ?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_402.wav|Motion described it as a unique event.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_403.wav|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_404.wav|No, because it was too many.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_405.wav|It's too close to call.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_406.wav|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_407.wav|I decided to take my time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_408.wav|FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_409.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_410.wav|That is the ultimate revenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_411.wav|It certainly appeared that way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_412.wav|They are looking for profit.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_413.wav|I remain a buyer of the shares.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_414.wav|YOU thought it was a headache.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_415.wav|I am astonished at attack.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_416.wav|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_417.wav|There is a solution, she believes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_418.wav|Potions said he would drive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_419.wav|It was important to win the singles.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_420.wav|I'm pleased about one thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_421.wav|That's been all around Europe with me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_422.wav|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_423.wav|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p287/p287_424.wav|Both promotions come as no surprise.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_001.wav|Please call Stella.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_025.wav|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_026.wav|It is a disaster area.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_027.wav|Is this accurate?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_028.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_029.wav|Because we do not need it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_030.wav|I was an athlete.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_031.wav|It is a case of taking a risk.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_032.wav|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_033.wav|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_034.wav|It was fit for royalty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_035.wav|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_036.wav|President Bush is at war.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_037.wav|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_038.wav|I was scared.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_039.wav|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_040.wav|But it took a lot of bottle.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_041.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_042.wav|We need to chat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_043.wav|But it might have done.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_044.wav|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_045.wav|He is too weak to move.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_046.wav|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_047.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_048.wav|It will come all right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_049.wav|I was lost.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_050.wav|I guess I was lucky, though.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_051.wav|I was inspired by two things.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_052.wav|Sadly, it can't.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_053.wav|It's very odd.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_054.wav|It is unique.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_055.wav|It will take time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_056.wav|That's the truth.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_057.wav|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_058.wav|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_059.wav|Four other charges were dropped.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_060.wav|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_061.wav|They're appalled by that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_062.wav|Scotland had great assets.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_063.wav|Equity declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_064.wav|We should have known.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_065.wav|The end result is precisely the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_066.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_067.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_068.wav|That was the easy election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_069.wav|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_070.wav|Neither it is.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_071.wav|He seemed to lose his focus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_072.wav|It can be halted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_073.wav|It was chaotic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_074.wav|Is there a new way forward?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_075.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_076.wav|I've not thought about it.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_077.wav|People must remain vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_078.wav|This is the way things should be handled.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_079.wav|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_080.wav|It's all going to clear the debt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_081.wav|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_082.wav|Nothing is yet confirmed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_083.wav|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_084.wav|We have other options.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_085.wav|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_086.wav|By then, he was walking on water.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_087.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_088.wav|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_089.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_090.wav|It is a lifeline.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_091.wav|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_092.wav|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_093.wav|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_094.wav|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_095.wav|Journalists should make him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_096.wav|It was a good performance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_097.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_098.wav|I didn't play well last year.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_099.wav|It was an adventure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_100.wav|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_101.wav|I'm not depressed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_102.wav|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_103.wav|It's in his blood.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_104.wav|It had been played at festivals.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_105.wav|We do not expect any surplus.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_106.wav|It is so sad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_107.wav|They were behind the wheel.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_108.wav|The fire was above the hole.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_109.wav|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_110.wav|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_111.wav|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_112.wav|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_113.wav|It is rubbish.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_114.wav|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_115.wav|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_116.wav|That's all right then.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_117.wav|There were no grounds for his action.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_118.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_119.wav|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_120.wav|I'm so angry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_121.wav|It has removed a bit of guilt.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_122.wav|So the European elections are extremely important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_123.wav|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_124.wav|Well, you can have a tree.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_125.wav|I had relied on him.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_126.wav|You've got to be vigilant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_127.wav|The goals were good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_128.wav|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_129.wav|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_130.wav|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_131.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_132.wav|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_133.wav|Is that Titanic?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_134.wav|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_135.wav|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_136.wav|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_137.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_138.wav|He should have won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_139.wav|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_140.wav|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_141.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_142.wav|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_143.wav|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_144.wav|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_145.wav|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_146.wav|Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_147.wav|They were later discharged from hospital.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_148.wav|This latter point is hugely important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_149.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_150.wav|It was so new, so exciting.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_151.wav|I'm just enjoying every match.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_152.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_153.wav|It has to be now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_154.wav|I was in the train station overnight.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_155.wav|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_156.wav|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_157.wav|I have got a wife to feed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_158.wav|It is not too late to get on board.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_159.wav|They will do their own thing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_160.wav|Does that put pressure on us?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_161.wav|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_162.wav|It is too much for me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_163.wav|It is a terrible place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_164.wav|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_165.wav|Nobody did in those days.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_166.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_167.wav|He was a crazy man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_168.wav|They thought they had found a home.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_169.wav|The jury is still out.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_170.wav|It's quite a routine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_171.wav|It should be easy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_172.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_173.wav|Tony had arrived.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_174.wav|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_175.wav|There is no point in looking any further.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_176.wav|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_177.wav|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_178.wav|Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_179.wav|It's a joke.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_180.wav|It just came into my head that day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_181.wav|They really did a great job.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_182.wav|It is tough, but possible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_183.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_184.wav|People will ask about us.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_185.wav|If the director is with you.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_186.wav|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_187.wav|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_188.wav|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_189.wav|Peace was won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_190.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_191.wav|I wanted to put myself on the line.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_192.wav|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_193.wav|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_194.wav|The conference is the first test.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_195.wav|Is that success?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_196.wav|But we are not immune to the problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_197.wav|They are in the euro.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_198.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_199.wav|But she might be.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_200.wav|It's all about money, money, money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_201.wav|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_202.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_203.wav|Now, it's all right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_204.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_205.wav|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_206.wav|Feel the heat?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_207.wav|She should not be blamed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_208.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_209.wav|It had all been arranged.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_210.wav|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_211.wav|In each case they were a goal down.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_212.wav|I was so nervous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_213.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_214.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_215.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_216.wav|Who was on the panel?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_217.wav|A career as a doctor is on hold.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_218.wav|We've got the bronze.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_219.wav|Mental health is a massive issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_220.wav|You have to do your research.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_221.wav|We played them off the pitch.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_222.wav|But it will be sorted out this week.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_223.wav|It was good fun.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_224.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_225.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_226.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_227.wav|The track is currently covered in snow.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_228.wav|The body follows the mind.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_229.wav|However, no further action was taken by police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_230.wav|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_231.wav|It is set in Paris.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_232.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_233.wav|I haven't made the donation yet.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_234.wav|And a film maker was born.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_235.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_236.wav|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_237.wav|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_238.wav|He's got to go.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_239.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_240.wav|It's too much work.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_241.wav|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_242.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_243.wav|It is hard won.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_244.wav|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_245.wav|In fact, we were all over the shop.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_246.wav|He's a lovely young man.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_247.wav|A friendship that will endure.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_248.wav|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_249.wav|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_250.wav|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_251.wav|I told you I was ill.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_252.wav|It's a source of deep concern.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_253.wav|This is a big club.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_254.wav|It is very important that we get the balance right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_255.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_256.wav|I was happily surprised.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_257.wav|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_258.wav|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_259.wav|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_260.wav|Blood samples were taken.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_261.wav|We shall rely on human beings.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_262.wav|This is a question of Islam.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_263.wav|It looks as though he will be right.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_264.wav|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_265.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_266.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_267.wav|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_268.wav|And Michael was just great.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_269.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_270.wav|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_271.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_272.wav|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_273.wav|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_274.wav|I am an estate agent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_275.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_276.wav|It happens from time to time.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_277.wav|But I've won both ways.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_278.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_279.wav|You've got to have both sides.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_280.wav|He will address the nation this evening.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_281.wav|The attacker died in the crash.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_282.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_283.wav|Who will perform?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_284.wav|It's like a high school play.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_285.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_286.wav|This is a national crisis.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_287.wav|The death toll included five children.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_288.wav|Who did the recruiting?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_289.wav|So I did.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_290.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_291.wav|Sunday's game was not a trial.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_292.wav|Who can predict?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_293.wav|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_294.wav|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_295.wav|We have to sort it out ourselves.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_296.wav|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_297.wav|The home was now under new management.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_298.wav|I thought it was my only chance.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_299.wav|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_300.wav|Nothing is safe.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_301.wav|One was a lawyer.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_302.wav|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_303.wav|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_304.wav|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_305.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_306.wav|It's just not funny!
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_307.wav|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_308.wav|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_309.wav|It's certainly different.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_310.wav|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_311.wav|We want to play at the worlds.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_312.wav|He was solid.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_313.wav|This is the culture change in medicine.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_314.wav|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_315.wav|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_316.wav|I never thought it would take this long.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_317.wav|My whole life has changed.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_318.wav|They wanted the club to make money.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_319.wav|Hartley should know.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_320.wav|Kids are terrible.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_321.wav|The home team had an amazing start.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_322.wav|My body is clearly capable.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_323.wav|For the moment, our position remains the same.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_324.wav|I had my suspicions.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_325.wav|However, the groups denied the claims.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_326.wav|There was some merit in that.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_327.wav|I came into this world with nothing.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_328.wav|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_329.wav|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_330.wav|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_331.wav|We agreed to disagree.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_332.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_333.wav|Donald was his friend.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_334.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_335.wav|She did not attend the courtroom.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_336.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_339.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_340.wav|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_341.wav|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_342.wav|These days are long gone.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_343.wav|He's been the key to everything.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_344.wav|The boat was fantastic.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_345.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_346.wav|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_347.wav|It was good for us that they lost that day.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_348.wav|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_354.wav|There is no room for error.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_355.wav|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_356.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_357.wav|He's very explosive.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_358.wav|We have to move forward.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_359.wav|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_360.wav|However, it was well worth the wait.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_361.wav|Our numbers are small.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_362.wav|That would help.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_363.wav|So I left.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_364.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_365.wav|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_367.wav|I am a star.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_368.wav|Not so, it seems.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_369.wav|Who was the mystery MP?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_370.wav|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_371.wav|The play is based on a real-life event.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_372.wav|Now, though, he has an incentive.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_374.wav|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_375.wav|We do not get that impression now.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_376.wav|They play together perfectly.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_377.wav|It was a funny game.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_378.wav|It is a large number.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_379.wav|I am a wealthy person.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_380.wav|Colour was at the core of his life.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_387.wav|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_388.wav|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_389.wav|It's just outrageous.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_390.wav|It's like a basketball.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_391.wav|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_392.wav|He is on the wrong side.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_393.wav|It is not normal practice.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_394.wav|This is a major step forward for carers.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_395.wav|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.

/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_398.wav|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_399.wav|He's already made history.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_400.wav|Then , he laughs.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_401.wav|You ask the question.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_402.wav|That is not in the interests of anyone or any party.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_403.wav|What would be the point?
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_404.wav|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_405.wav|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_406.wav|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p288/p288_407.wav|The real enemy is in your own back yard.

from earth to their home in the sky./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_025.wav|I was not involved in these discussions./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_026.wav|O, Is he

poor./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_031.wav|Three days later, he was killed./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_032.wav|I don't expect to be here tomorrow./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_033.wav|Or it's not really for us, if you like./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_034.wav|It was a

me./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_047.wav|Structural changes were also required./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_048.wav|We suffered a lot for seven

well./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_053.wav|Fewer people are being killed in accidents./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_054.wav|I'm trying not to think about that./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_055.wav|Ms Jackson was not at the meeting./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_056.wav|I find the whole affair disturbing./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_057.wav|One woman refused to sit down./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_058.wav|We're in a state of shock and disbelief./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_059.wav|I was completely knackered./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_060.wav|There are two interests in this

proposals./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_067.wav|We tend to come good at the end./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_068.wav|His record with England was not

table./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_077.wav|It is true, but it is only part of the issue./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_078.wav|THERE's only one word for

afternoon./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_092.wav|His presence was very important./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_093.wav|We are pursuing legal action against the

clean./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_096.wav|Let's see that increase over the years./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_097.wav|That, though, is an old story./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_098.wav|The real issue is personal./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_099.wav|Life becomes a

learn?/data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_106.wav|On that basis, he would set it aside./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p292/p292_107.wav|That, however, is the end of the good

rainbows./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p304/p304_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p304/p304_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p304/p304_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p304/p304_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p304/p304_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p304/p304_025.wav|So we will cut their numbers./data3/VCTK/VCTK-Corpus/wav48/p304/p304_026.wav|Who cares about
