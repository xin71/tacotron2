/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M018.wav|Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F018.wav|Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M019.wav|Well
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M020.wav|Obviously ma'am

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M022.wav|Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M023.wav|Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F019.wav|No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M024.wav|Well, if I knew that, then I'd know where it was, wouldn't I
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F020.wav|Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M025.wav|Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M026.wav|That's what the cost of the ticket was for
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M027.wav|Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F022.wav|Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M028.wav|Right. Yes, ma'am
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F023.wav|And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M029.wav|Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F024.wav|That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M030.wav|Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F025.wav|No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M031.wav|Well, my hands are really tied then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F026.wav|Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M032.wav|Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F027.wav|Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M033.wav|Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F028.wav|Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M034.wav|Uh, so it was really heavy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F029.wav|So I would have carried it on, but they made me check it and then they lost it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M035.wav|Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F030.wav|There's nothing else you can do
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M036.wav|I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F031.wav|I don't believe that for a second
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M037.wav|Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M038.wav|Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F032.wav|No, I don't think you are. I mean If you were doing everything you could, you'd either give me more money or you'd figure out where my bag is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M039.wav|Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F033.wav|What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M040.wav|makes up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F034.wav|You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M041.wav|The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F035.wav|You could go into the computer and- you know- print
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M042.wav|I've gone into the computer.  I told you exactly what I can see in the computer that your luggage did arrive here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F036.wav|So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M043.wav|Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F037.wav|And you have no guarantee

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F038.wav|This is ridiculous
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M045.wav|How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F039.wav|Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M046.wav|Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F040.wav|Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M047.wav|Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculou
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F041.wav|No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M048.wav|Right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F042.wav|It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M050.wav|And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_M004.wav|No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_M005.wav|I could hear him right through the floor of my room

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_M008.wav|Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_M011.wav|Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um.  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F016.wav|why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_M017.wav|You know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F017.wav|Well I got an idea.  But what's the story
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_M018.wav|I'm going to ask her to marry me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F018.wav|Well that's nobody's business but yours, Chris
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_M019.wav|You know that's not just my business

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_M020.wav|So it's all right.  I can go ahead with it then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F020.wav|Well you're want to make sure your father isn't you know going to--lose the
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_M021.wav|Then it's not only my business.  Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_M022.wav|You know that?  Isn't it your business too, if I tell dad, and he gets, throws a fit about it?   you have such a talent for ignoring things
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F021.wav|I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F023.wav|Now Chris you can go on from there, but I don't know what to do.  I mean do you know what to do, because I don't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_M024.wav|I don't know why it is.  But every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time, after time
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F024.wav|Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_M025.wav|To hell with that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F025.wav|Have you asked Annie yet to marry you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_M026.wav|I want to get this settled first
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F026.wav|Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F027.wav|The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never hav
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_M028.wav|So what, I'm not fast with women
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F028.wav|Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_M029.wav|Because it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F029.wav|well, that's a good reason, but it doesn't answer a thing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_M030.wav|I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F030.wav|No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F031.wav|You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_M031.wav|All right, then, Mom
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F032.wav|Give it some more thought
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F033.wav|What the hell is this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_M033.wav|I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe, maybe New York

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_2/Ses05F_script01_2_F000.wav|Why did you invite her here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_2/Ses05F_script01_2_M000.wav|Why does that bother you

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_F020.wav|It wouldn't work like this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M023.wav|It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M024.wav|Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_F021.wav|yeah sure
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M025.wav|Yeah.  I lost them
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_F022.wav|how many
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M026.wav|just about all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_F023.wav|Oh gee
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M027.wav|Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M030.wav|I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M031.wav|And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M032.wav|but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M034.wav|And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M035.wav|It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M038.wav|And if you're not, then it's all just loot and it's got blood on it, and I don't want any of it!  And, I guess that included you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_F024.wav|Do you still feel like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M039.wav|I I want you now, Annie

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_1/Ses05F_script02_1_M019.wav|Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_F027.wav|No I don't want a-  Your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  If you marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_F028.wav|Now, what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_F029.wav|Just give it some more thought
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_M031.wav|I've given it three years of thought.  I had hoped if I waited, dad would've forgotten him by now and we could have a- a regular wedding and everybody happy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_M032.wav|But if that can't happen then I'll just get out

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_M033.wav|I'll get out.  I'll go get married someplace else, I- I'll live someplace else, maybe New York

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_M036.wav|Yeah, I'd like one hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, I'd like to go home to something beautiful.  I'd like a family.  I'd like some kids

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_F038.wav|Yeah, I can see that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_F000.wav|Why did you invite her here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_M000.wav|Why does that bother you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_F001.wav|She's been in New York three and a half years, why all of a sudden
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_M001.wav|Well, maybe maybe he just wanted to see her again
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_F002.wav|Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_M002.wav|What are you talking about?  He grew up next to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?  Don't look at me like that.  He hasn't told me anything he didn't told you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_F003.wav|He's not going to marry her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_M003.wav|Why do you think he's even thinking that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_F004.wav|He's got that about it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_M004.wav|Well, so what
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_F005.wav|What's going on here, Joe
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_M005.wav|Now listen
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_F006.wav|No.  She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_M006.wav|You don't know.  You can't read her mind
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_F007.wav|Then why is she still single? I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_M007.wav|How do you know why she's waited
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_F008.wav|Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_M008.wav|Look, it's a beautiful day outside, why are we arguing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_F009.wav|Nobody in this house dares takes her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_M009.wav|Well, what do you want me to do about it?  What do you want
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_F010.wav|I want you to pretend like he's coming back.  Both of you, don't think I haven't noticed you and Chris since she's gotten here.  I don't want any nonsense
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_M010.wav|But Kate
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_F011.wav|No, because if she- he's not coming back then I'll kill myself. Laugh!  Laugh at me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_F012.wav|But why did that happen the very night she came back?  She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_M011.wav|Calm yourself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_F013.wav|Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_M012.wav|Calm yourself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_F014.wav|Only last week a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_F015.wav|You above all have got to believe

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_M015.wav|What's that suppose to mean, me above all?  Look at you, you're shaking
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_F017.wav|I can't help it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_M016.wav|What have I got to hide, Kate?  What the hell is the matter with you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F000.wav|You're the only one I know who loves his parents
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M000.wav|I know.  It's going out of style, isn't it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F001.wav|It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M001.wav|So, you're not sorry I came
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F002.wav|No.  But I'm not going to stay
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M002.wav|Why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F003.wav|Well, your mother, first of all, pretty much told me to leave
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M003.wav|Well
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F004.wav|You saw that.  And well you've been -
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M004.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F005.wav|You've been sort of embarrassed since I got here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M005.wav|Well, I planned on kind of sneaking up on you in a period of a week or so, but they all take it for granted that we're set
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F006.wav|I figured they would, your mother at least
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M006.wav|How did you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F007.wav|Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M007.wav|Well, so would you want to?  I mean, I guess you know that's why I asked you to come
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F008.wav|Yes, that's why I came
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M010.wav|You feel it's wrong here, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me, Annie. I- I don't want to win you away from anything
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F009.wav|Oh, Chris I've been ready for a long time
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M011.wav|So he's gone forever then?  You sure
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F010.wav|I almost got married two years ago
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M012.wav|Why didn't you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F011.wav|You started to write me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M013.wav|You felt something that far back
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F012.wav|Everyday since
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M014.wav|Annie, why didn't you call me or tell me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F013.wav|Well, I mean, until then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you sure can be ambiguous
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M015.wav|Give me a kiss, Annie.  Give me a -

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F014.wav|I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've sat around wondering if I was crazy for thinking of you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M017.wav|Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm going to make you so happy

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M018.wav|I kissed you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F016.wav|Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What's the matter
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M019.wav|Lets go for a ride.  I I- I want to be alone with you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F017.wav|No.  Chris, what is it?  Is it your mother
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M020.wav|No, nothing like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F018.wav|You have to tell me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F019.wav|Even in your letters there was something ashamed

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F020.wav|You have to tell me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M022.wav|I don't I don't know where to start
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F021.wav|It wouldn't work like this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M023.wav|It's so mixed up with so many other things
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M024.wav|You remember when I was overseas, I was in command of a company

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M025.wav|I lost them
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F023.wav|How many

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M027.wav|It- It takes time to toss something like that off,I mean, because they weren't just men
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M034.wav|I mean, the whole thing was like some kind of bus accident to them
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M035.wav|So I went back to work for my dad and that whole rat race again
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M036.wav|I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M039.wav|And I guess that included you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F024.wav|Do you still feel like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M040.wav|I want you now, Annie

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_1/Ses05M_script02_1_M020.wav|and all that about flopping around, it's like laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating or something like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_1/Ses05M_script02_1_M021.wav|I mean, this is a big night for these guys.  You know, life's last orgy

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_1/Ses05M_script02_1_M026.wav|We weren't in a good spot
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_1/Ses05M_script02_1_F019.wav|We didn't see them the first time either

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_1/Ses05M_script02_1_M031.wav|And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_1/Ses05M_script02_1_F020.wav|That's the wind

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_2/Ses05M_script02_2_F001.wav|It's ridiculous
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_2/Ses05M_script02_2_M002.wav|It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact

It keeps us all coming back for more.  It keeps us thinking that life is gonna start now any minute if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_2/Ses05M_script02_2_M004.wav|Are we talking about the same thing

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F024.wav|I know you did.  You threw it out the window into the Canal below.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M034.wav|Come to think of it, the real cause of that roues was Peter Burden

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_2/Ses05M_script03_2_M001.wav|I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_2/Ses05M_script03_2_F001.wav|Only a trivial little broach
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_2/Ses05M_script03_2_M002.wav|I remember it well, covered in diamonds and the worst possible taste

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_2/Ses05M_script03_2_F003.wav|[garbage], No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_2/Ses05M_script03_2_F007.wav|Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never would have known about it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_2/Ses05M_script03_2_M008.wav|Well, that's a nice point of view I must say
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_2/Ses05M_script03_2_F008.wav|I'm getting very bored with this conversation
