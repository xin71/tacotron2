/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M002.wav|Who told you to get in this line
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F003.wav|You did
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F004.wav|You were standing at the beginning and you directed me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M003.wav|Okay. But I didn't tell you to get in this line if you are filling out this particular form
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F005.wav|Well what's the problem?  Let me change it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M004.wav|This form is a Z.X.four
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M005.wav|You can't--  This is not the line for Z.X.four.  If you're going to fill out the Z.X.four, you need to have a different form of ID
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F006.wav|What?  I'm getting an ID.  This is why I'm here.  My wallet was stolen
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M006.wav|No. I need another set of ID to prove this is actually you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F007.wav|How am I supposed to get an ID without an ID?  How does a person get an ID in the first place
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M007.wav|I don't know.  But I need an ID to pass this form along.  I can't just send it along without an ID
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F008.wav|I'm here to get an ID
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M008.wav|No.  I need another ID, a separate one
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F009.wav|Like what?  Like a birth certificate
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M009.wav|A birth certificate, a passport...a student ID; didn't you go to school?  Anything
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F010.wav|Who the hell has a birth certificate
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F011.wav|Yes but my wallet was stolen, I don't have anything.  I don't have any credit cards, I don't have my ID.  Don't you have things on file here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M010.wav|Yeah.  We keep it on file, but we need an ID to access that file
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F012.wav|That's out of control
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M011.wav|I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here.  It's just a simple form.  I just need an ID
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F013.wav|How long have you been working here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M012.wav|Actually too long
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F014.wav|Clearly.  You know, do you have like a supervisor or something
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M013.wav|Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Huh? Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Fine.  I'll be right back
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_F015.wav|That would - I would appreciate that.  Yeah

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_M000.wav|It's not fair
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_F001.wav|Yeah.  I know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_M001.wav|I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_F002.wav|I don't know.  I put in that. request too. They didn't..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_F003.wav|I guess, you know, everybody has to make sacrifices
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_M002.wav|I don't know, it's just not fair.  I think you've already made your sacrifice
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_F004.wav|There's people that have given more though, you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_M003.wav|I just don't see how they can make you leave when you have a new baby - we have a new kid

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_M004.wav|Then why is that fair?  Why-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_F006.wav|There's babies over there, though, that need mothers
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_M005.wav|I don't know how you can be okay with this?  I don't know why you're not-- you're fine with it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_F007.wav|I'm not okay with it, but I don't-- it's not like I have a choice.  I don't see what crying about it is going to fix
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_M006.wav|I'm just trying to think of another way.  I'm just trying to..

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F007.wav|Yeah.  I saw a posting at the theatre

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M011.wav|I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F011.wav|A resume
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M012.wav|Yeah.  Do you have a resume
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F012.wav|No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M013.wav|It's kind of helpful when getting a job
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F013.wav|I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M014.wav|Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F014.wav|Yeah
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F015.wav|I don't like- I don't like sending things in the mail.  I don't want my information out there
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M015.wav|No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F016.wav|I'm there in front of them.  I'm telling them what I'm good at
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M016.wav|Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F017.wav|Why?  It's a piece of paper
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M017.wav|No.  But it has an outline, you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F018.wav|I just don't want this paper trail, you know.  I just don't want things following me around, like-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M018.wav|I know.  Okay.  Well, um. Maybe-

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M019.wav|Yeah
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M020.wav|Okay, yeah.  I would imagine
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F020.wav|..I just-..I just think it's kind of prejudiced and they are really discriminating against people who just aren't that way
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M021.wav|Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M002.wav|Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M004.wav|I guess he is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F006.wav|It's getting to be just like after he died.  What's the meaning of that

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F007.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M006.wav|Being dishonest with him, you know.  This kind of thing always pays off and it's paying off
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F008.wav|What do you mean dishonest
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M007.wav|You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F009.wav|What do you want to do?  Argue with him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M008.wav|I don't want to argue but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M009.wav|You know?  Why shouldn't he walk the nights thinking of him, dreaming of him?   Do we contradict him?  Do we say, we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years now
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F010.wav|You can't say that to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M010.wav|We've got to say it to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F011.wav|Where's the proof?  Do you have any proof
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M011.wav|For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years; that's insane
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F012.wav|To you it is, to me it is, but to your father, you can talk yourself until you are blue in the face.  But there is no grave and there is no body, so where are you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M012.wav|Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F013.wav|It's that the trouble is those God damn newspapers.  Every month some new boy comes back and so the next one is going to be Larry, they just-

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F014.wav|Why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M014.wav|You know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F015.wav|Well I got an idea, but what's your story
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M015.wav|I'm going to ask her to marry me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F016.wav|Well that's only your business, Chris
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M016.wav|You know it's not just my business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F017.wav|Well what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M017.wav|So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F018.wav|Well you want to make sure that your father is not going to -
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M018.wav|Then it's not just my business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F019.wav|I'm just saying
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M019.wav|You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F020.wav|Oh.  I ignore what I got to ignore.  That girl is Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M020.wav|She's not Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F021.wav|From your father's point of view, he is not dead and- Chris he still thinks he's still alive.  The girl is Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F022.wav|Now you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm telling you, I don't know where to go
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M021.wav|I don't know why it is, but every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because I am afraid other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F023.wav|You're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong in that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M022.wav|To hell with that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F024.wav|I just don't see why.  Have you asked Annie yet

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F025.wav|Then what?  Chris.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M023.wav|Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M024.wav|I don't even know how to start
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F027.wav|It wouldn't work like this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M025.wav|It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F028.wav|Yeah, sure
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M026.wav|Well I lost them

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M027.wav|Pretty much all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F030.wav|Aw, geez
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M028.wav|You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F031.wav|Mmhmm
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M034.wav|Driving my new car and seeing a new refrigerator
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M036.wav|And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F032.wav|Do you still feel that way
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M037.wav|I just want you to know Annie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F033.wav|Because you mustn't feel that way.  Everything you have, you've earned - everything.  you understand me

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M000.wav|What time is it?  I think it's supposed to run around midnight, right?  God, this is great, isn't it, Carla?  Look at this night we got here, huh
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M001.wav|Actually I want to get a little further up the coast, get away from all like the lights and the people, but...  How are you doing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_F000.wav|Fine
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M002.wav|Okay.  Is that, is that-

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M012.wav|Naturally.  God, how could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out, though

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M014.wav|Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know, we should have brought the blanket?  Our blanket
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M015.wav|Aw.  Do you know, I should have brought a six pack, too.  A six pack, that would be just the ticket right about now.  Huh
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M016.wav|God, I'm so excited, I'm like a kid.  I can't believe I got out of the house with my fly zipped up

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_1/Ses01F_script03_1_M038.wav|However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_1/Ses01F_script03_1_F031.wav|Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M002.wav|I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F002.wav|Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M003.wav|It was bristling with diamonds.  In the worst possible taste, too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F003.wav|It was not.  I still have it, and I wear it often.  It is very pretty

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F004.wav|I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M005.wav|Well, you let him kiss you, huh?  You said you did
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F005.wav|Well, what of it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M006.wav|What of it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F006.wav|It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M007.wav|What about me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F007.wav|If you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M008.wav|That's a nice point of view, I must say

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M009.wav|So am I.  I'm bored stiff. [GARBAGE]  Do you want some brandy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F009.wav|No.  Thank you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M010.wav|I'll have a little, I think
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F010.wav|I don't know why you'd want any, you've already had three glasses
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M011.wav|No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F011.wav|I just think it's silly to go on and on and on about such a thing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M012.wav|You can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long, going on and on and on
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F012.wav|It's become a habit with you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M013.wav|Oh.  Don't be so grand.  Just because you don't happen to want one at the moment
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F013.wav|Don't be stupid
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M014.wav|Really, Amanda
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F014.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M015.wav|Nothing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M016.wav|you going out somewhere, dear
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F015.wav|No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M017.wav|That reply has broken my heart
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F016.wav|Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M018.wav|Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F017.wav|No it isn't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M019.wav|Yes it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F018.wav|You shut up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M020.wav|Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F019.wav|It's funny it hasn't worked such wonders for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M021.wav|Snap, snap, snap.  You know you are like a little adder
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F020.wav|Adders don't snap, they sting
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M022.wav|Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F021.wav|They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M023.wav|Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F022.wav|Yes I did, quite a lot
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F023.wav|Mind your own business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F024.wav|You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M025.wav|I think I am not in the least bit drunk
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F025.wav|You've always had a weak head
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M026.wav|I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F026.wav|On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F027.wav|Oh shut up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F028.wav|Shut up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F029.wav|Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M028.wav|[LAUGHTER] That's a very good idea.  I think I will
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M029.wav|Look, you better turn that off. I don't want to wake up the people upstairs
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F030.wav|Why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F031.wav|There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M030.wav|Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F032.wav|They are away in Tunis
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M031.wav|This is no time of year for Tunis

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M032.wav|I will do no such thing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F034.wav|Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M033.wav|Will you turn that off, it's driving me mad
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F035.wav|You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M036.wav|Oh.  That's very amusing indeed
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F037.wav|Oh shut up.  Let go.  I hate you, I hate you.  Do you hear?  You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M037.wav|You are a vile, ill-tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I never want to see you again as long as I live
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F038.wav|This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F012.wav|What do you want to do, argue with him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M011.wav|I don't want to argue with him, it's just for God's sake it's time he realized that no one believes with him any more
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F013.wav|You can't say that to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M012.wav|I got to
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F014.wav|What, can you prove it?  What proof do you have?  Can you prove it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M013.wav|For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F015.wav|To you it is, to me it is.  But to your father?  You can talk yourself 'til you're blue in the face but there's was no grave and there is no body.  So where are you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M014.wav|Okay, all right.  Mom, sit down.  I want to talk to you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F016.wav|The trouble is those god damn news papers.  Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M015.wav|Yeah, okay all right, all right.  Listen, um, you know why I asked Annie here, right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F017.wav|Why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M016.wav|You know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F018.wav|Well, I've got an idea but what's the story
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M017.wav|I'm going to ask her to marry me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F019.wav|Well, that's only your business, Chris
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M018.wav|You know it's not just my business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F020.wav|Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough known your own business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M019.wav|So it's okay then?  I'm just going to go ahead with it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F021.wav|You want to make sure that your father's not going to..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F022.wav|I'm just saying
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F023.wav|I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M021.wav|She is not Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M022.wav|I don't know why it is you know every time I reach out for something I have to pull back 'cause I'm afraid it's going to hurt somebody.  All my life..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F025.wav|You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M023.wav|To hell with that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F026.wav|Did you ask Annie yet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M024.wav|No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F027.wav|Well, how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels same way your father does
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M025.wav|Well, if she does then that's the end of it.  However from her letters I think she's pretty much forgotten him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F028.wav|The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M026.wav|So what?  I'm just--I'm not fast with women
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F029.wav|I don't see why it has to be Annie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M027.wav|Because it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F030.wav|That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M028.wav|I don't know, it I think of her, I grew up next to her.  She is what I think of when I think of a wife
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F031.wav|He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F032.wav|Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M029.wav|All right then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F033.wav|Give it some more thought
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M030.wav|I've given it lots of thought.  And I keep coming back to the same thing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F034.wav|What the hell is this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M032.wav|I'll leave.  I'll get married and move somewhere else maybe New York
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F035.wav|Are you crazy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M033.wav|I'll do it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F036.wav|You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M034.wav|Business?  The business doesn't inspire me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F037.wav|Oh, must you be inspired
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M035.wav|Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M036.wav|If that can't happen here..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F038.wav|You mean to tell me you would leave the business for this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M037.wav|Yes, on this I would
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F039.wav|Well, you don't want to think like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M038.wav|Then help me stay here mom
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F040.wav|All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for.  This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M039.wav|I know, I know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M040.wav|Then help me stay
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F041.wav|Well, you don't think like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M041.wav|I am thinking like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F042.wav|I don't understand you, do I
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M042.wav|No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F043.wav|Well, I can see that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_2/Ses01M_script01_2_F000.wav|Why did he invite her here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_2/Ses01M_script01_2_M000.wav|Well, maybe he wanted see her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_2/Ses01M_script01_2_F001.wav|It's been three and a half years.  Why all of a sudden
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_2/Ses01M_script01_2_M001.wav|Well uh, He grew up next door to the girl, why wouldn't he want to see her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_2/Ses01M_script01_2_M002.wav|Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything he told you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_2/Ses01M_script01_2_F002.wav|He's not going to marry her

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_2/Ses01M_script01_2_F005.wav|The girl is not Larry's.  If the girl is Larry's girl she's not his she know she's not

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_2/Ses01M_script01_2_F006.wav|Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men probably a hundred people told her she is crazy but she is waited

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_F018.wav|Well, why didn't the D.M.V. put that you needed your birth certificate on the application then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M018.wav|I--when you're going to the D.M.V., you usually need pretty professional identification-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M019.wav|You know, Official documentation-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_F019.wav|Yeah, but your birth certificate--I mean, who carries around their birth certificate?  Nobody does that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M020.wav|No, but you come--you come to the D.M.V., it's something-- You should've- You should've figured-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_F020.wav|With your driver's license and your passport.  Just like everybody else
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M021.wav|But, without your drive--where-where- what about your identification without your driver's license?  I mean, you need--you needed something before then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_F021.wav|Who--you always use your driver's license.  I mean, you're not coming to the D.M.V. if you're not over sixteen and that's when you get your driver's license so you're never gonna need it anyway
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M022.wav|All right.  Well, um, you know, I'd love to help you, but--nothing I can do
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M023.wav|So, if you wanna go get your birth certificate, um, maybe come back--I don't--maybe you can talk to the person in the--in the front of line maybe.  I don't know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_F022.wav|Do you have a supervisor
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M024.wav|I am the supervisor.  So-

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F000.wav|It's almost time for me to go
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_M000.wav|I can't believe that--now--are you sure this is absolutely necessary?  Like-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F001.wav|There's nothing I can do.  I mean, the government you know-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_M001.wav|What--what're we gonna do here?  I can't--I can't do this by myself.  I-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F002.wav|You're gonna have to.  I mean, you're a great father.  You can do it.  I know you can

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F003.wav|I don't think so
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F005.wav|You could send me pictures
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_M004.wav|It's not going to be the same
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_M005.wav|What if--maybe--what if, uh, we went somewhere over there?  I don't--I don't know--I--I need to figure something out for this because-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F006.wav|Their not gonna let you.  You have to stay home and I have to go.  I mean, that's all-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F007.wav|and--I mean, my daughter--I don't want to put her in danger.  You know?  She has to stay
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_M006.wav|This is gonna be a--a crucial yet--she's--she's growing up.  She's gonna need you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F008.wav|I know, but, she needs to be safe more.  She needs to be around kids her age--own age.  She needs to be able to play on the streets and-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F009.wav|You can just remember it for me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_M008.wav|I don't know--I don't know--I don't know how--I don't know how this could even be possible for you--I--if I was-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F010.wav|Well, I need--I need you to be able to do this for me 'cause I can't do anything about it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F011.wav|I mean, it's just as hard for me, but--I know that we can do it, you kno
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_M009.wav|I mean, you just get to--go off and do your thing.  I mean, yeah, we're both--I don't know--it's bad for both of us, but-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_M010.wav|...it would be so much better if we can--if we could stay together somehow.  You know--we could--we could do this together

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_M014.wav|All right, Sure.  A yeah, that- that'd be good
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_F020.wav|Okay.  Great.  What time of the day would you like
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_M015.wav|Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess.  You know-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_F021.wav|All right.  Great.  Well we have a very open flight that leaves at nine a.m. and fortunately uh the time change actually goes um backwards from that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_F022.wav|So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning.  So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_M016.wav|And, like, there's there's shuttles or something that I can get to the hotel
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_F023.wav|Absolutely.  That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel.  You just give me your address.  We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_F024.wav|And a there will also be a shuttle waiting for you to take you to the appropriate hotel
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_M017.wav|Okay.  Wow.  Sounds good then, I guess.  Thank you very much. It's a lot better than talking to a machine
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_F025.wav|Yeah--I completely understand.  It's a difficult process sometimes and we want to make traveling as easy as possible
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_M018.wav|All right.  So we're confirmed then or do you--All right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_F026.wav|Absolutely. Thank you so much for calling and we hope that you will come to us again
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_M019.wav|Okay
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_F027.wav|Thank you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F000.wav|What's he gonna say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M000.wav|He saw it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F001.wav|How could he see it?  I was the first one up, he was still in bed
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M001.wav|He was out here when it broke
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F002.wav|When
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M002.wav|About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F003.wav|What was he doing out here at four in the morning
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M003.wav|I don't know.  When it cracked, he ran back in the house and cried in the kitchen
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F004.wav|Did you talk to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M004.wav|No.  I thought it was best to leave him alone
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F005.wav|He cried hard
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M005.wav|I could hear him right through the floor of my room
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F006.wav|What was he doing out here at that hour
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F007.wav|He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M006.wav|I guess he is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F008.wav|He's getting just like after he died.  What is the meaning of that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M007.wav|I don't know the meaning of it.  But, I know one thing Mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F009.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M008.wav|Being dishonest with him.  I mean, that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F010.wav|What you mean dishonest
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M009.wav|You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F011.wav|What do you want to do argue with him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M010.wav|No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M011.wav|Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F012.wav|You can't say that to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M012.wav|We've got to say it to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F013.wav|Can you prove it?  How can you prove it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M013.wav|For God sakes, it's been three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F014.wav|To you it is and to me, but not to him.  I mean, you can talk yourself blue in the face, but he--there's no body and no grave so where are you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M014.wav|Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F015.wav|Trouble is the God damn newspapers.  Every month or so a boy turns up out of nowhere so, you know, the next one is gonna be Larry
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M015.wav|All right.  All right.  Listen to me.  You know why I brought Annie here don't you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F016.wav|Why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M016.wav|You know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F017.wav|I've got an idea, but what's the story
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M017.wav|I'm gonna ask her to marry me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F018.wav|Well, that's only your business, Chris
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M018.wav|You know it's not only my business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F019.wav|What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M019.wav|So it's all right then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M020.wav|I'll go ahead with it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F020.wav|Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't going to-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M021.wav|Well, then it isn't just my business-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F021.wav|I'm just saying that-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M022.wav|Ah, sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  I mean, isn't it your business too if I tell Dad and flips--freaks out about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F022.wav|I ignore what I gotta ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M023.wav|She's not Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F023.wav|From your father's point of view, he isn't dead.  And you've no right to take his girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F024.wav|And you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.  Now what can I do for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F025.wav|You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M025.wav|To hell with that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F026.wav|[BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M026.wav|I wanted to get this settled first
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F027.wav|Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F028.wav|Trouble is, you don't see enough women
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F029.wav|You never did
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M028.wav|So what, I'm not fast with women
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F030.wav|I just don't see why it has to be Annie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M029.wav|Because it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F031.wav|Well, that's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.  I mean, you've been away for--at war.  It's been five years
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M030.wav|I can't help it.  I know her best.  I mean, I grew up next door to her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M031.wav|These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F032.wav|I don't want a diagram.  Umm-- He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F033.wav|I mean, what's gonna happen to your father?  Do you know?  I don't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M032.wav|All right.  All right, then, Mom
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F034.wav|I just--give it some more thought
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M033.wav|I've given it three years of thought.  I thought that if I waited Dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M034.wav|But if I can't--if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F035.wav|What the hell is this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M035.wav|I'll get out.  I'll get married and go live some place else.  Maybe New York
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F036.wav|Are you crazy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M036.wav|I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F037.wav|What about the business?  What the hell is this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M037.wav|The business?  The business doesn't inspire me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F038.wav|Must you be inspired
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M038.wav|Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M039.wav|I want a family.  I want kids.  I want something that I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now, where do I find it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F039.wav|Tell me, you'd leave the business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M040.wav|Yes, on this I would
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F040.wav|Well, you don't want to think like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M041.wav|Then help me stay here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F041.wav|All right, but just don't go thinkin' like that 'cause otherwise what did we work for?  I mean, the whole thing is for you, Chris.  The whole shootin' match is for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M042.wav|I know.  I know, Mom.  Just help me stay here

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F044.wav|I can see that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F000.wav|Why did he invite her here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M000.wav|Why does that bother you

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F006.wav|What's going on here, Joe
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M006.wav|Now, listen Kate
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F007.wav|She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M007.wav|You can't read her mind
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F008.wav|Well then why is she still single?  I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy, but she's waited
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M008.wav|How do you know why she's waited
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F009.wav|She knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M009.wav|Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F010.wav|Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe?  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M010.wav|Well, what do you want me to do about it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F011.wav|I want you to act like he's coming back.  Both of you.  Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here.  I won't stand for any nonsense
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M011.wav|But Kate-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F012.wav|Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F013.wav|But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M012.wav|Calm yourself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F014.wav|Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M013.wav|Calm yourself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F015.wav|Last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  I mean, you read it yourself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M014.wav|All right.  All right.  Calm yourself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F016.wav|You, above all, have to believe
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M015.wav|What?- Why- Why me above all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F017.wav|Just--just don't stop believing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M016.wav|What does that mean?  Me above all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M017.wav|Look at you.  Look at you shaking
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_F018.wav|I can't help it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M018.wav|What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F000.wav|You're the only one I know who loves his parents
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M000.wav|I know, it went out of style, didn't it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F001.wav|It's all right.  It's a good thing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F002.wav|You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M001.wav|You're not sorry you came
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F003.wav|No, not sorry.  Um, but, I'm- I'm not gonna stay
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M002.wav|Why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F004.wav|Well, for one thing, your mother as much as told me to go
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M003.wav|Oh
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F005.wav|You saw that.  I mean and then, well, you've been kind of, um-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M004.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F006.wav|Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M005.wav|The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But, they take it for granted that we're all set
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F007.wav|I knew they would, your mother anyway
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F008.wav|Well
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F009.wav|from her point of view, why else would I come
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M006.wav|Oh.  Would you want to?  I guess you know, this is why I asked you to come
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F010.wav|I--I guess this is why I came
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M007.wav|Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M008.wav|I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M009.wav|I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M010.wav|You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F011.wav|Oh, Chris, I've been ready for a long, long time
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M011.wav|And he's gone forever.  You're sure
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F012.wav|I almost got married two years ago
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M012.wav|Why didn't you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F013.wav|You started to write me and-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M013.wav|You felt something that far back
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F014.wav|Every day since
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M014.wav|Anne, why didn't you let me know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F015.wav|Well, I was waiting for you.  I mean, till then you never wrote and when you did, I mean, what did you say?  You can sure be ambiguous sometimes
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M015.wav|Give me a kiss, Anne.  Give me a
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M016.wav|oh God, I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long--how long I've been waiting to kiss you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F016.wav|I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M017.wav|Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm gonna make you so happy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F017.wav|Not like that you're not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M018.wav|I kissed you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F018.wav|Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M019.wav|Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F019.wav|No.  What is it, your mother
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M020.wav|No.  Nothing like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F020.wav|Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M021.wav|Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F021.wav|You've gotta tell me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M022.wav|I don't know how to start
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F022.wav|It wouldn't work this way
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M023.wav|It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F023.wav|Yeah, sure
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M024.wav|Well, I lost them
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F024.wav|How many
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M025.wav|Just about all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F025.wav|Oh, gee
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M026.wav|It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M028.wav|They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M030.wav|You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M033.wav|I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M034.wav|Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F026.wav|You still feel that way
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M035.wav|I want you now Annie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F027.wav|'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything that you have.  Do you understand that?  Everything, Chris, and me too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F028.wav|I mean, and your money, there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M036.wav|I know Annie.  Annie, I'm gonna make a fortune for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F029.wav|What'll I do with a fortune
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M000.wav|What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M001.wav|This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M002.wav|I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M003.wav|How you doing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F000.wav|Fine
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M004.wav|Is that--no--is that just foam?  I can't even tell
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M005.wav|Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M006.wav|How you doing?  Aw, you know what I forgot?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F001.wav|What flashlight
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M007.wav|You know, the flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one isn't there

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F004.wav|You kept saying my flashlight, if as if somehow it's just yours.  I mean is that supposed to make me feel
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M010.wav|Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F008.wav|There is no point in coming down here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M019.wav|Right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F009.wav|That's my point
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M020.wav|That's my point too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F010.wav|So, let's go
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M021.wav|No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F011.wav|Not particularly
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M022.wav|Why not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F012.wav|I just don't.  It's stupid
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M023.wav|Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year, you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M024.wav|Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F013.wav|Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, they flop around, and swim away.  And then they die
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M025.wav|Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M026.wav|this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F014.wav|What are you so excited about?  I mean, it's not a moon landing we're talking about here.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M027.wav|Yeah they do
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F015.wav|Ah, Augie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M028.wav|Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M029.wav|There's--there's a bit of the magic--some unexplainable here.  I don't see how you can not be interested
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F016.wav|I'm just not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M030.wav|For real
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F017.wav|Yeah
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M031.wav|I don't get it.  The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M032.wav|And last year, I remember specifically you were so excited to go that you stubbed your toe rushing me out of the house and didn't even notice until we got in the car
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F018.wav|Last year, you will also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got in a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the grunions
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M033.wav|We weren't in a good spot
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F019.wav|We didn't see them the first time either
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M034.wav|We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  Believe me, I've got good instincts for these things
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M035.wav|There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M036.wav|Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M037.wav|Somewhere out there, this huge mass of silver fish swimming this way
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M038.wav|They don't know why, we don't know why.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map, it wasn't a decision, just
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M040.wav|It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M041.wav|They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M042.wav|Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F020.wav|That's the wind
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M043.wav|Well, so what do you think
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F021.wav|About what
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M044.wav|What I was saying
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F022.wav|It's ridiculous
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M000.wav|Well, so what do you think
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F000.wav|About what
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M001.wav|What I was saying
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F001.wav|It's ridiculous
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M002.wav|It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F002.wav|It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is gonna take place on the beach
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M003.wav|Well, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M004.wav|Are we talking about the same thing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F004.wav|Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M005.wav|Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F005.wav|God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M006.wav|Well, what's bugging you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F006.wav|We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M007.wav|There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F007.wav|For heaven sake, we're not going to see the grunions
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M008.wav|Why not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F008.wav|We never do, do we?  I mean, have we ever
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M009.wav|We've missed them twice.  That's not ever
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F009.wav|Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M010.wav|Well, we'll see them this year
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F010.wav|No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M011.wav|I thought you wanted to see it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F012.wav|You don't understand anything I'm saying
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M012.wav|No, of course not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F013.wav|I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M013.wav|It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F014.wav|For heaven sake, this isn't about fish
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M014.wav|All right.  Look, I've been trying to work this backwards, but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M015.wav|I mean, you were-  you were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see.  I took a shower.  You watched the news
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M016.wav|You said, "Hey the grunion are running tonight."  I said, "Great, let's go.  I feel lucky.
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M017.wav|Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F015.wav|Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F016.wav|I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F017.wav|And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F018.wav|And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M018.wav|Wait a minute.  I've got it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F019.wav|Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M019.wav|It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, "let's get some champagne," and I said, "time's a wasting" or something like that, right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M020.wav|Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F020.wav|I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M021.wav|Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F021.wav|No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M022.wav|You want me to go get some champagne

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M023.wav|Take off our shoes
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F023.wav|No. No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M024.wav|Well, what?  You want me to breathe in your ear
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F024.wav|No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M025.wav|You wanna get married again

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M027.wav|A vacation
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F027.wav|No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M028.wav|A new carpet?  A poodle?  Ice cream?  Back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What?  Carla, what the hell do you want
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F028.wav|I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M029.wav|Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M030.wav|No.  You think I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like a used Kleenex?  Or that I'd look at you and think, holy hell, when's the next flight to Alaska
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M032.wav|'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F029.wav|This.  What?  What is this?  This isn't even anything
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M033.wav|Yes, it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F030.wav|Uh, right this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M034.wav|Right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F031.wav|Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M037.wav|Maybe if you were with somebody else too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F035.wav|I didn't say that

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F037.wav|Oh, don't be ridiculous.  I mean, don't you know that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F038.wav|You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M040.wav|Well, now that you mention it.  No, I don't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F039.wav|Okay.  Fine so.  We're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M041.wav|I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F040.wav|Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M042.wav|Well, look what we have here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F041.wav|Augie, you brought refreshments
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M043.wav|It's not champagne
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F042.wav|Well, then we don't need glasses
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M044.wav|You still cold?  Do you wanna go home
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F043.wav|No.  I think you might be right.  Maybe this is the spot after all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F044.wav|Augie, I'm sorry
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M045.wav|Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F045.wav|Or not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M046.wav|Or not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M000.wav|Good God
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F000.wav|Do you think it's them
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M001.wav|I wonder
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F001.wav|Well, nobody know we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M002.wav|Must be them, then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F002.wav|What're we gonna do
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M003.wav|We're all right, darling, aren't we?  Whatever happens
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F003.wav|Now and always, sweet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M004.wav|I don't care then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F004.wav|It was bound to come sooner or later
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M005.wav|Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F005.wav|Ah, it send shivers up my spine
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M006.wav|What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F006.wav|Behave exquisitely
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M007.wav|With the most perfect poise
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F007.wav|Oh, of course.  I shall probably do a court curtsy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M008.wav|Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F008.wav|What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M009.wav|Oh, darling, don't say that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F009.wav|It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M010.wav|Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F010.wav|Yes, meaning just that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M011.wav|Oh, what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F011.wav|Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M012.wav|You mustn't be serious, my dear one.  That's just what they want
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F012.wav|Who's they
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M013.wav|All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M014.wav|Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F013.wav|If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M015.wav|Certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun, alright
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F014.wav|Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M016.wav|Who knows
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F015.wav|Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M017.wav|No, that desire will fade.  Along with our passion
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F016.wav|Oh, dear, shall we like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M018.wav|Depends on how well we've played
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F017.wav|Well, what happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the one that's left still laugh
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M019.wav|Yes.  Yes. With all his might
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F018.wav|That's serious enough, isn't it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M020.wav|No. No, it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F019.wav|Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M021.wav|So is everyone else in the long run
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M023.wav|Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F020.wav|Elliott, worms don't pop
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M024.wav|I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as you love me best
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F021.wav|Oh, thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M025.wav|You remember that awful scene we had in Venice
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F022.wav|Which particular one
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M026.wav|The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F023.wav|Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M027.wav|Ah, horrible thing.  I hated it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F024.wav|Yes, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M028.wav|How long did that row last
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F025.wav|It went in intermittently for days
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M029.wav|The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F026.wav|It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M030.wav|That was a rouser, wasn't it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F027.wav|That was the first time you ever hit me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M031.wav|I didn't hit you very hard
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F028.wav|The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M032.wav|Oh, I'll never forget his face
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F029.wav|It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M033.wav|We were very much younger then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F030.wav|And very much sillier
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M034.wav|As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M000.wav|As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F000.wav|Honey, you knew there was nothing in that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M001.wav|I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F001.wav|Presents?  Just a trivial little broach
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M002.wav|Ah, yes, I remember it well.  Bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F002.wav|No, it wasn't.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M003.wav|You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F003.wav|No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M004.wav|You must admit, he was in love with you, wasn't he
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F004.wav|Just a little perhaps, nothing serious
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M005.wav|You let him kiss you.  You said you did
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F005.wav|Well, what of it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M006.wav|What of it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F006.wav|It didn't hurt him at all and I enjoyed it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M007.wav|Well, what about me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F007.wav|Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M008.wav|Well, that's a nice point of view I must say
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F008.wav|I'm bored with this conversation
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M009.wav|Me, too.  Bored stiff.  You want some brandy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F009.wav|No, thanks
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M010.wav|I think I'll have some
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F010.wav|Don't see why you want any.  You've already had two glasses
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M011.wav|No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F011.wav|Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M012.wav|You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F012.wav|Well, it's become a habit with you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M013.wav|You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F013.wav|Don't be so stupid
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M014.wav|Really, Amanda
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F014.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M015.wav|Nothing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M016.wav|Going out somewhere dear
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F015.wav|No, just making myself fascinating for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M017.wav|That reply has broken my heart
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F016.wav|A woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M018.wav|As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F017.wav|No, it isn't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M019.wav|Yes, it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F018.wav|Oh, be quiet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M020.wav|Ah, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro02/Ses02M_impro02_F011.wav|It doesn't make any sense; I don't know why we have to be at war in the first place
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro02/Ses02M_impro02_M012.wav|I know, but it's not our decision, I guess, you know, I mea

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_M017.wav|Yea, that way she was guaranteed that she could not say no
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_F015.wav|Right exactly because you can't say no in front of thousands of people. [LAUGHTER
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_M018.wav|No, but it was good

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_M023.wav|I don't know either do a honeymoon like in the snow or fly down to like Australia, Southern Hemisphere, [GARBAGE] so we'll decide with that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_F020.wav|Ooh, that would be fun
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_F021.wav|Do you think you'll get a house or something, like you guys are looking to buy some place o
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_M024.wav|Yea, yea, I'm not too sure where yet I guess you know, I kind of got to figure some stuff out here firs
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_F022.wav|Yeah. [LAUGHTER
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_M025.wav|but like you know it's just - I guess we're just excited right now that we'll get to continue it together
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_F023.wav|Oh my Gosh. I cannot believe you're getting married, that is so cool

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_M027.wav|Oh, it will, obviously you know. But I know it's something - I don't know, you never really think about it happening, like before hand

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M000.wav|Uhm, I don't kno
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F000.wav|So how you feeling
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M001.wav|I don't know what I'm going to do about this; I mea
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M002.wav|I have got to get a job, you know? Like
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F001.wav|You've been doing a lot of work for it, right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M003.wav|Well, yea you know, I get my resumes and I mean I
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F002.wav|Right, so the fact you doing the best that you can is 
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M004.wav|I go out all the places I can, every place that'll give an interview you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F003.wav|you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M005.wav|But it's been so long, like what - what am I - what am I waiting -- I should probably just do something else, o
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F004.wav|Well, but you care about what you do, right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M006.wav|I don't know, I mean why - wh
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F005.wav|I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and u
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M008.wav|Well, and that's what I begin to question after a while is maybe I just don't want it, maybe it's not even worth it, you know, lik
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M009.wav|I don't even know if it's going to be worth it because I can't break myself in, you know like I can't - can't even get a foot in the door you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F006.wav|Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M010.wav|Yea, it says I'm stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F007.wav|You are persistence. I mean that's important. that'
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M011.wav|I mean, I can't- I can't be persistent forever, you know, you can't not have a job forever, you know, I've got- I've got to do something, I've got to make money and get food on the table
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F008.wav|Well, you're talented so keep that in mind, you know, you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M012.wav|I mean, maybe I'm not, you know. I don't have a job. Maybe - maybe I'm not as good as-as I thought I was an
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M013.wav|I just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out an
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F009.wav|I'm sorry
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M014.wav|I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinkin
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M015.wav|maybe - maybe take up painting, I don't know, you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M016.wav|Do something that I don't have to go out and do something, stay at home, I don't know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M017.wav|Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F010.wav|That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean lik
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F011.wav|and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F012.wav|So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M018.wav|I know, but I mean- if that's the - you know, I'm either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet I mean this doesn'
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F013.wav|It might be the latter I don't know because you're not the worst, I mean you're great, you very talented at what you do
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M019.wav|this doesn't happen to a normal person
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F014.wav|You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F015.wav|But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M020.wav|I mean, I don't know, I don't see - I don't see any other way - any other way around it right now
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F016.wav|Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M021.wav|What am I going to do on a break
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F017.wav|Get out of town or something, I mean you need - you need to clear your head 'cause you seem like you're really frustrated about it. I mean you need to like, be excited about you're doing, rather than, you know upset
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M022.wav|Right. Thanks for talking to me

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F005.wav|Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this tha
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F006.wav|Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_1/Ses02M_script01_1_M034.wav|I've given it three years of thought. I thought that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_3/Ses02M_script01_3_M024.wav|It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in charge of a company

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_1/Ses02M_script02_1_M025.wav|Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_1/Ses02M_script02_1_M028.wav|Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the Lemmings throwing themselves off the cliff

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_M029.wav|I imagine, as I may have already mentioned, I've had three minute liquor glasses of Brandy the whole evening long a child of two couldn't get drunk on that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_F027.wav|On the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of Brandy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_M030.wav|Oh very interesting. How about a child of four, a child of six or a child of nine

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_F030.wav|Why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_M034.wav|Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_M021.wav|About three million dollars

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_M023.wav|-to make up the three million dollars
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_F024.wav|Well, ten hours worth of minutes-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_F025.wav|is what's going to happen
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_M024.wav|Ten hours? So, basically, a day's worth of minutes which I pay forty dollars a month from it

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_F028.wav|and we will take care of it if anything happens.  But all we can do now is ask for your patience
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_F029.wav|Okay? Thank you for calling.  Goodbye
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F000.wav|What's he going to say? Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M000.wav|He saw it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F001.wav|What-how did he see it? I mean, I was the first one up. He was still in bed
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M001.wav|He was out there when it happened
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F002.wav|When
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M002.wav|Um, about four this morning. Uh- I heard a crack and I looked out and I saw him standing there
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F003.wav|What was he doing out at four in the morning
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M003.wav|I don't know. But after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F004.wav|Did you talk to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M004.wav|No, I uh-, I figured the best thing to do was to leave him alone
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F005.wav|He cried hard, huh
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M005.wav|I could hear it right through the floor
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F006.wav|What was he doing out there at that time? He was dreaming about him again. He's walking around at night again
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M006.wav|I guess he is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F007.wav|Could he-he's acting just like he did after he died, you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F008.wav|What's the meaning in that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M007.wav|I don't know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M008.wav|But I know one thing, mom. We've made a terrible mistake with dad
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F009.wav|Well, what do you mean? What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M009.wav|Being dishonest with him. That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F010.wav|What do you mean, dishonest
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M010.wav|You know Larry's not coming back and I know that too. Why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F011.wav|What, you're going to argue with him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M011.wav|No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time that he realized that no one believes that Larry's coming back anymore
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F012.wav|You can't tell him that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M012.wav|We got to tell him that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F013.wav|We can't. It just won't work
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M013.wav|You know, for God's sakes it's been three years. No one comes back after three years. It's insane
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F014.wav|They do come back
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F015.wav|I know, but he doesn't know that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F016.wav|Three years has been a long time
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M014.wav|All right. Just- Sit down, mom. I want to talk to you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F017.wav|It's those Goddamn newspapers, you know? I mean, it's like every day they come out with this new person that comes along. And the next one's going to be Larry
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M015.wav|All right. All right. Just come on, sit down
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F018.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M016.wav|You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F019.wav|Why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M017.wav|You know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F020.wav|Well, I have an idea, but go on, tell me, what's the story
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M018.wav|I want to ask her to marry me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F021.wav|Well, that's only your business, Chris
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M019.wav|Come on, you know that's not only my business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F022.wav|Well, it is. I mean, what do you want me to do? You're grown up; you know what's going on in your mind
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M020.wav|So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F023.wav|Well, you better make sure your father's not- No- I'm just saying
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M021.wav|See, then it's not just my business. God, you hav
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M022.wav|-Oh, you infuriate me sometimes. You know, it's not just my business too if dad throws a fit
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M023.wav|God. You have such a talent for ignoring things
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F024.wav|Yeah, well I ignore what I got to ignore
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F025.wav|And she-she's Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M024.wav|No, she is not Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F026.wav|Well, from your father's point of view she is. I mean, he's still alive. You've got no right to take her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F027.wav|If you go on from that point, I don't know where you go
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F028.wav|'Cause listen, I'm telling you, I don't know where to go from there. Do you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M025.wav|Oh, I don't know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F029.wav|What do you want from me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M026.wav|Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F030.wav|You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M027.wav|To hell with that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F031.wav|There's nothing wrong with it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M028.wav|I didn't ask Annie yet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F032.wav|You didn't ask her yet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M029.wav|I wanted to get this settled first
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F033.wav|Well, how do you know she's going to marry you? I mean, what if she feels the same way as your father
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M030.wav|Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M031.wav|I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad, right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M032.wav|Mom, don't avoid me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F034.wav|You know, the trouble is you've never had enough women. No, you never did
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M033.wav|So what? I'm not fast with women
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F035.wav|I don't understand why it has to be her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M034.wav|Because it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F036.wav|That's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M035.wav|I just
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F037.wav|I mean, you haven't seen her since the war. I mean, it's been five years
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M036.wav|It just is. I
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M037.wav|I grew up with her. Okay. All these years, when I think of someone I want to be my wife I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F038.wav|No, I don't want a diagram
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F039.wav|He thinks he's coming back. You go-go on and marry her, I mean, you're pronouncing her dead. And what's going to happen to your father, huh? I don't know. Do you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M038.wav|Okay. All right, then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F040.wav|Just, listen. Give it more thought, is all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M039.wav|No, I've given it three years of thought
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M040.wav|And I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M041.wav|But if I can't have that here then I'll get out
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F041.wav|What the hell is this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M042.wav|I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F042.wav|You're crazy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M043.wav|I've been a sucker too long. I'm through with it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F043.wav|You're what-you're going to leave the business? But you can't do that. What the hell is this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M044.wav|The business. The business doesn't inspire me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F044.wav|Oh, you have to be inspired
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M046.wav|Now, Annie's in the middle of all that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M047.wav|Now, where do I find it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F045.wav|Tell me something
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F046.wav|You'd leave that business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M048.wav|Yes. On this I would
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F047.wav|You can't do that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M049.wav|Then help me stay here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F048.wav|All right, but you can't do that. You can't talk like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M050.wav|Okay. Just

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M053.wav|No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F053.wav|Yeah. I can see that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F000.wav|Why did you invite her here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M000.wav|Why? Does that bother you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F001.wav|She's been in New York for three-and-a-half years. She don't just suddenly come and
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M001.wav|Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F002.wav|You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M002.wav|What do you mean? They lived next door to each other their entire lives. Why shouldn't he want to see her? Hey, don't look at me like that. I don't know anymore than you do
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F003.wav|He's not going to marry her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M003.wav|How do you know he's even thinking about it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F004.wav|It's got that about it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M004.wav|Well, so what
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F005.wav|What's going on here, Joe
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M005.wav|Listen, kid
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F006.wav|She's not Larry's girl. She knows that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M006.wav|You can't read her mind
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F007.wav|Then why is she married? Then why isn't she married? She's been in New York and there's hundreds of single men there
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F008.wav|I'm sure hundreds of them asked her and told her that she's foolish, but no
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F009.wav|She's waited
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M007.wav|How do you know why she's waited
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F010.wav|Because she thinks like me, that's why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F011.wav|She's faithful as a rock, don't you know. In my worst moments I can think of her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F012.wav|I think again, that I'm-I'm right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M008.wav|Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F013.wav|Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers, but not his father, not his brother
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M009.wav|Calm yourself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F014.wav|Because he's not coming back. Then what do I got to live for? I'll kill myself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M010.wav|Calm yourself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F015.wav|Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F016.wav|Look at it. Because why, when she came here and she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Look at it, look at it, Joe
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M011.wav|All right. All right. Calm yourself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F017.wav|You got to believe, believe with me because I can't stand all alone
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M012.wav|Okay. Just calm yourself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F018.wav|No, you've got to believe
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F019.wav|Believe, Joe. You above all people have got to believe
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M013.wav|Why me, above all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M014.wav|Huh
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M015.wav|Why me above all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F020.wav|You got to keep believing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M016.wav|Look at you, you're shaking
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F021.wav|I can't help it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M017.wav|What have I got to hide
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M018.wav|Huh? What the hell's the matter with you, Kate
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F000.wav|You're the only one I know that still loves his parents
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M000.wav|Yeah. I know. It went out of style, didn't it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F001.wav|No, it's all right. There's nothing wrong in that, you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F002.wav|It's really lovely here. The air is sweet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M001.wav|You're not sorry you came
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F003.wav|No. I'm not sorry. It's
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F004.wav|I can't stay
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M002.wav|Why not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F005.wav|Well, for one thing, your mother so much has told me to go. [LAUGHTER]
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M003.wav|Well
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F006.wav|Look
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F007.wav|you've been acting kind of, well, you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M004.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F008.wav|Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M005.wav|Yes, I guess I have been. But it's going from me now
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F009.wav|Yeah
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M007.wav|How did you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F010.wav|Yeah, they would. Especially your mom
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M008.wav|Well, uh- would you want to
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M009.wav|I, I guess that's why I asked you to come
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F011.wav|Well, I mean
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M010.wav|Oh, Annie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F012.wav|from her opinion, why else would I come here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M011.wav|Annie, I love you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M012.wav|I love you a great deal
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M013.wav|I-I love you. I have no imagination. That's all I know how to tell it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F013.wav|Well, I guess that's why I came
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M015.wav|I don't want to win you from anybody. I want you to be ready for me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F014.wav|I've been ready for a long, long time
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M016.wav|Then he's gone forever. You're sure
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F015.wav|Loo
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F016.wav|I was almost married two years ago
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M017.wav|Why didn't you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F017.wav|'Cause you started to write me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M018.wav|You felt something that far back
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F018.wav|Every day since
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M019.wav|Why didn't you let me know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F019.wav|Well, I don't know, you didn't write until then and then when you did, what'd you say
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F020.wav|You always can be so ambiguous
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M020.wav|Give me a kiss, Annie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M021.wav|Give me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F021.wav|I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M023.wav|We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F022.wav|Not like that, you're not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M024.wav|I kissed you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F023.wav|Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F024.wav|What is it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M025.wav|Let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F025.wav|No. What is it? Is it your mother
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M026.wav|No, no, no, no. Nothing like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F026.wav|Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M027.wav|Yeah. I guess there is. I guess I was, but uh- it's going from me now
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F027.wav|You should tell me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M028.wav|I don't know where to start
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F028.wav|But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M029.wav|You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F029.wav|Yeah, sure
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M030.wav|Well, I lost them
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F030.wav|How many
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M031.wav|Just about all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F031.wav|Geez
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M032.wav|It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M033.wav|For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M035.wav|And I, and I thought something watching them go down
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M037.wav|And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M038.wav|And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M041.wav|Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M042.wav|And I didn't want to take any of it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M043.wav|And I guess that included you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F032.wav|And you still feel that way
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M044.wav|I want you now, Annie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F033.wav|Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F034.wav|I mean, there's nothing wrong in that money, and your father put good planes up in the air and you should be proud of that. A man should be paid for that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M045.wav|Annie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M046.wav|Annie, I'm going to make a fortune for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F035.wav|What am I going to do with a fortune
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M000.wav|Hey, what time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight, right? God, this is great, isn't it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M001.wav|Look at the night we got; couldn't be better

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F009.wav|Well, so let's go
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M021.wav|No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F010.wav|Not particularly
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M023.wav|Why not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F011.wav|I don't know. I just don't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F012.wav|Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M025.wav|Yeah. But that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. And all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you-spawning or mating or something like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M026.wav|I mean, this is the big night for these guys. Life's last orgy

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M027.wav|Yeah, they do
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F014.wav|Oh, God, Augie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M028.wav|What, okay, then it's fish that do something no other fish do. Like the swallows in Capistrano or the lemmings who throw themselves off the cliffs
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M029.wav|There's magic here and mystery and a little bit of the unexplainable. I mean, I don't see how you cannot be interested

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M030.wav|For real
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F016.wav|Yes
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M031.wav|I don't get it. The last time-the first time that we came to see it you said it was the best night of your life
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M032.wav|And then last year when we came to see it you ran out of the house so fast that you stubbed your toe. And you didn't even notice until you got in the car
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F017.wav|Yes, and if you also remember, I got sand in my panties. We got into an argument about nothing. You got a sore throat and we never saw the grunions
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M033.wav|We weren't in a good spot
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F018.wav|No, for God's sakes, we've never seen the grunions. We're not going to see them
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M034.wav|We just weren't in a good spot, all right? This is a much better spot. I have a good instinct for these things. Look, is that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M035.wav|no, that's just seaweed, isn't it? This is great, isn't it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M036.wav|I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M038.wav|And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M040.wav|its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M043.wav|So what do you think
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F020.wav|About what
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M044.wav|About what I just said
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F021.wav|It's ridiculous
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M000.wav|So what do you think
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F000.wav|About what
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M001.wav|About what I was just saying
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F001.wav|It's ridiculous
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M002.wav|It certainly is not. It is slightly exaggerated scientific fact
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F002.wav|It's so P.R. I mean, somebody's giving you a good bill about this wonderful event that's going to happen on the beach

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F003.wav|Exactly. Everyone else is told the same thing. It keeps them feeling excited. Keeps them coming back. Keeps them thinking life's going to start at any minute now
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M004.wav|Are we talking about the same thing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F004.wav|I don't care. It's still fish to me

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F011.wav|It's impossible. It's like waiting around. Waiting to see Santa Claus, you know

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F014.wav|Look, I did. I always do. But it's like every time I try nothing ever happens
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M012.wav|It's just fish. Nothing to get traumatized over

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M013.wav|I've been turning this thing over in my head trying to figure out when the point was when we took a turn for the worse, and I can't seem to pinpoint it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M015.wav|And so I'm getting the animals, putting the animals out in the yard. I'm putting on my jacket, getting the car out of the garage

Do you think I had some great fantasy down the line? That four years down the line that we'd come to the beach and argue with each other over fish

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F035.wav|No, it's not. It's standing on the beach waiting and fighting
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M032.wav|Right

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F043.wav|Well, I guess we're just in the wrong spart-spot with the right person
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M039.wav|Seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view of the moon we've got from here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F044.wav|I noticed that. It's beautiful

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F047.wav|You brought refreshments
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M041.wav|It's not champagne
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F048.wav|At least we won't need glasses

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F049.wav|So I was thinking you might be right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F050.wav|Maybe this is the right place after all

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_F002.wav|I mean, nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_F013.wav|Shall we always want to bicker and fight
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_M015.wav|No. The fire will fade along with our passion

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_M018.wav|No. No, it isn't. Death's very laughable. A cunning little mystery. All done with mirrors

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_F019.wav|Thank you, dear. The same applies to you. Except that if I ever so much as catch you looking at another woman I'll kill you

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_F022.wav|I know you did. You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal. I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M001.wav|I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M004.wav|You must admit that he was in love with you

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M012.wav|No particular reason. Anyhow, they were very small ones
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F012.wav|I don't see what's the point of going on and on about something like this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M013.wav|Oh, my-you can hardly call three minute liquor glasses in the evening going on and on and on
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F013.wav|It's become a habit with you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M014.wav|You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F014.wav|Don't be so stupid
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M015.wav|Really, Amanda
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F015.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M016.wav|Nothing
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M017.wav|Going somewhere, dear
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F016.wav|No. Just making myself fascinating for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M018.wav|That reply has broken my heart
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F017.wav|It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M019.wav|As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F018.wav|No, it isn't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M020.wav|Yes, it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F019.wav|No, it's not. I don't care
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M021.wav|It's a pity you didn't have more brandy. It might have made you a little less disagreeable
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F020.wav|Well, it didn't seem to do such wonders with you, now did it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M022.wav|Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F021.wav|Adders don't snap, they sting
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M023.wav|Yes, they do. They have a big bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F022.wav|They sting
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M024.wav|They snap
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F023.wav|I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M025.wav|Uhh
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M026.wav|did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F024.wav|Yes, I did, quite a lot actually
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M027.wav|I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then, didn't you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F025.wav|Mind your business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M028.wav|You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F026.wav|You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M029.wav|I'm not in the least bit drunk
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F027.wav|You've always had a weak head
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M030.wav|Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F028.wav|On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M031.wav|Oh, very interesting indeed. How about a child of four or a child of six or a child of nine. We might have a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F029.wav|Do shut up. Shut up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F030.wav|I don't want to talk about this anymore

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F031.wav|Why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M033.wav|It's very late and it will annoy the people upstairs
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F032.wav|There aren't any people upstairs. It's a photographer's studio
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M034.wav|Well, I suppose the people downstairs then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F033.wav|They're away in Tunis

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F035.wav|Turn it on
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M037.wav|No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F036.wav|You've always had far too temperamental for yourself. You should try to control it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M038.wav|Turn it off

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M021.wav|Okay.  So then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F021.wav|Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M022.wav|Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes.  Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit?  Huh?  God you have such a talent for ignoring things
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F022.wav|Well I'm just saying-
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F023.wav|You know I ignore what I got to ignore
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F024.wav|She's not...she's Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M023.wav|She's not Larry's girl
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F025.wav|From your father's point of view he is still alive and if you try and take her that's just not fair.  You can't do that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M024.wav|I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want I have to pull bac
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F026.wav|And-And-And if you go on from there if you know already to go on from there, then you can.  But I'm telling you something that I don't know where to go.  You got it?  I mean, do you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M025.wav|Because other people will suffer
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M026.wav|My whole entire, bloody life time and time again
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F027.wav|You're a considerate fellow.  There is nothing wrong in that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M027.wav|Well to hell with that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F028.wav|Did you ask Annie yet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M028.wav|I wanted to get this settled first
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F029.wav|And what if she doesn't marry you huh?  What if she feels the same way your father does
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M029.wav|Then I guess that's the end of it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M030.wav|But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M031.wav|And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F030.wav|Look, you never had seen many, many women.  You know?  I mean..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M032.wav|Well so what?  I'm just not fast with women
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F031.wav|Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M033.wav|Because it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F032.wav|Well that's a good answer but, it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you left to go to the war and it's been five years
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F033.wav|No I don't want a diagram
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M035.wav|Alright then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F035.wav|Look, just give it some thought okay
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M036.wav|I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M037.wav|But if I can't have that here I'll get out
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F036.wav|What the hell is this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M038.wav|I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F037.wav|Are you crazy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M039.wav|I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F038.wav|You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M040.wav|The business doesn't inspire me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F039.wav|Oh, you have to be inspired
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M042.wav|Now Annie is in the middle of all that.  Where do I find it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F040.wav|Tell me something.  You can leave this business
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M043.wav|Yes.  On this I would
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F041.wav|You can't talk like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M044.wav|Then help me stay here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F042.wav|Alright but you can't talk like that you hear
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F043.wav|I mean what the hell have we worked for then?  I mean, it's all for you Chris.  The whole shooting match is for you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M045.wav|I know.  Just you help me stay here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F044.wav|Alright but you don't talk like that you hear?  You don't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M046.wav|I am thinking like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F045.wav|I don't understand you do I
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M047.wav|No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F046.wav|Yeah.  I can see that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F000.wav|Why did he invite her here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M000.wav|Why does that bother you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F001.wav|Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M001.wav|Well maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F002.wav|Nobody travels seven hundred miles just see
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M002.wav|uh-uh What do you mean?  They grew up next to each other their entire lives.  Why shouldn't he want to see her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M003.wav|Hey don't look at me like that.  I don't know anymore than you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F003.wav|He's not going to marry her
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M004.wav|Who said he even thought about that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F004.wav|I see it.  It has the appearance of it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M005.wav|Well, so what
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F005.wav|What's going on here Joe
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M006.wav|Now listen kid..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F006.wav|No.  She's not his girl Joe and she knows that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M007.wav|You can't read her mind
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M008.wav|How do you know why she's waited?  Hmmm
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F008.wav|Because she knows what I know, that's why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F009.wav|I mean, her faith is stronger than a rock
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F010.wav|My worst times I think about her, you know, and 
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F011.wav|it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M009.wav|Look at how nice the day is.  What are we arguing for
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F012.wav|No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M010.wav|What do you want me to do?  What do you want
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F013.wav|I want-I want you to act like he's still alive.  I mean don't think I haven't seen the way that you've been since he invited her here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M011.wav|But Kate..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F014.wav|But I won't have any of this nonsense because you know what happens?  If he doesn't come back I'll kill myself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M012.wav|Okay. Calm yourself. Just calm yourself
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F016.wav|I can't do it all alone
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M013.wav|Calm yourself, alright
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F017.wav|Look, it was just last week that Detroit, some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry, you can read it for yourself. You above all people have got to believe
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M014.wav|Alright, alright, calm yourself okay?  Calm yourself. Wait, wait.  What do you mean, me above all

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M016.wav|Look at you, you're shaking
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F019.wav|I can't help it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M017.wav|What do I got to hide?  Huh?  What the hell's the matter with you Kate
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F000.wav|You're the only one I know that still loves his parents
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M000.wav|I know.  It sort of went out of style didn't it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F001.wav|No.  It's alright.  It's a good thing, you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F002.wav|It's lovely here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F003.wav|The air is so sweet

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M002.wav|Why
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F005.wav|First of all your mother so much as told me to go
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M003.wav|Well..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F006.wav|Look
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F007.wav|you saw the way that she acted and then well, I mean, you, you were acting kind of..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M004.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F008.wav|Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M005.wav|Well the trouble is I was planning on sneaking up on you over a week or so and they take it for granted that we're all set
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F009.wav|Yeah.  I know they would, especially your mother
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M006.wav|How did you know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F010.wav|Well what other reason, from her point of view, would I be coming here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M007.wav|So, would you want to
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M008.wav|I mean, that's the reason why I asked you here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F011.wav|Well

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F012.wav|I guess that's why I came
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M011.wav|I don't...I have no imagination that's the only way I know how to tell it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M012.wav|I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell you this here.  I wanted to drive someplace brand new where we'd be brand new to each other.  It feels wrong here don't you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M013.wav|This yard and this chair.  I don't want to win you from anything, I want you to be ready for me

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M014.wav|Then he's gone forever, you sure
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F014.wav|Look, I almost got married two years ago
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M015.wav|Why didn't you

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M016.wav|You felt something that far back
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F016.wav|Every day since
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M017.wav|Why didn't you let me know
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F017.wav|I was waiting for you Chris, I mean, till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F018.wav|You'd always be so ambiguous

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F025.wav|Tell me what's wrong.  I mean, even in your letters you seemed ashamed
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M025.wav|Well, yes I guess I've been ashamed but, it's going from me

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M026.wav|I don't know where to start
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F027.wav|Okay.  It wouldn't work like this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M027.wav|You remember overseas I was in command of a company

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M028.wav|Well I lost them
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F029.wav|How many
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M029.wav|Just about all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F030.wav|Geez
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M030.wav|Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M031.wav|For instance, one time this...it had been raining several days and this one kid, he came up to me, he gave me his last pair of dry socks, put them in my pocket
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M032.wav|That's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys I had.  They didn't just die, they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M033.wav|A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M034.wav|It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M035.wav|And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M037.wav|And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M038.wav|It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive.  I felt wrong to have that new checkbook
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M039.wav|open that new bank account, drive the new car and see the new refrigerato
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M041.wav|Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M042.wav|And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F032.wav|Cause you must not feel that way again.  You hear me?  You can't.  You deserve everything you have Chris

/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F004.wav|Look, I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M005.wav|I thought you wanted to see it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F005.wav|It's just..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F006.wav|Look, we just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to be like
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F007.wav|For heavens sake, grow up.  We're not going to see the Grunions
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M007.wav|Why not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F008.wav|We never do, do we?  Have we ever
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M008.wav|Oh my gosh.  We missed them twice, that's hardly ever
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F009.wav|Okay.  Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M009.wav|Carla, can I ask you something
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F010.wav|What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M010.wav|Don't take this wrong but, are you having your period
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F011.wav|Augie, god dammit, don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M011.wav|What's bugging you then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F012.wav|Look, it's pointless.  It's...we're not going to see the Grunions I mean, it's like waiting around to see Santa Claus, you know, it's..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F013.wav|Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M012.wav|I thought you wanted to see it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F014.wav|God, you don't understand anything
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M013.wav|No, of course not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F015.wav|I do.  I always do.  I keep thinking, this time will be the time and it never is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M014.wav|Well, we're going to see it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F016.wav|No we won't.  I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M015.wav|What...I've been trying to, I've been trying to figure out the point where we went wrong and I can't seem to pinpoint that moment
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M016.wav|You were fine during the phone call with Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M017.wav|Let's see I took a shower, you were watching the news, you said hey, hey the Grunions are running tonight and I said great let's go, I feel lucky tonight
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M018.wav|And then I'm putting the animals out in the yard, I'm pulling the car out of the garage, putting my jacket on
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F017.wav|Look, do you remember the first time we came here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F018.wav|We thought I was pregnant
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F019.wav|We brought a bottle of champagne and we took off our shoes and danced barefoot in the sand..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F020.wav|Under the moon and you whispered so softly into my ear so I could feel your words
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F021.wav|And I thought, this is it.  This is how happy I'm supposed to be
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M019.wav|Wait a minute.  I've got it
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F022.wav|What?  Dancing barefoot in the sand?  Drinking out of a bottle of champagne
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M020.wav|It was in the car right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M021.wav|And you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M022.wav|You want this to be like the other time right?  That's it right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F023.wav|I'd rather not remember something..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F024.wav|Rather not hope for something
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M023.wav|Okay, right.  I got it.  Sure.  Of course.  Listen, do you want to dance
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F025.wav|No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M024.wav|Do you want me to get some champagne
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F026.wav|No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M025.wav|Take off our shoes
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F027.wav|No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M026.wav|What?  Do you want me to breathe in your ear
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F028.wav|No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F029.wav|No...No...No..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F030.wav|No..
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F031.wav|I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M028.wav|Welcome to the human race
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M029.wav|Do you think that this is what I had in mind?  That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?  No
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M031.wav|...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F032.wav|This what...what's this?  This isn't anything. Alright.  Sure.  Standing on the beach, fighting and waiting
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M032.wav|Yes it is
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M033.wav|Right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F033.wav|Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M034.wav|No.  I know.  Me neither
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F034.wav|This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M035.wav|I'm trying to do the best I can
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F035.wav|I know you are Augie.  I know you wanted this evening to be nice
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F036.wav|I can't help thinking about being somewhere else
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M036.wav|Maybe if you were with someone else too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F037.wav|I didn't say that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M037.wav|I know.  But I know I don't make you happy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F038.wav|Augie, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing with you
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M038.wav|Yeah
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F039.wav|Yeah.  Don't you know that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F040.wav|If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you.  Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M039.wav|Actually, now that you mention it, no I don't
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F041.wav|Well, I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M040.wav|It seemed like a good spot to me
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M041.wav|I mean look at the view of the moon we got from here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F042.wav|Yeah.  I noticed that.  It's real pretty on the water
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F043.wav|Big old white moon
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M042.wav|Hey, look what we got here
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F044.wav|Oh you brought refreshments
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M043.wav|It's not champagne
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F045.wav|Well at least we won't need glasses
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M044.wav|Are you still cold?  Do you want to go home
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F046.wav|No I'm beginning to think you might be right
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F047.wav|I think this may be the place for us after all
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F048.wav|I am sorry Augie
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M045.wav|Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F049.wav|Or not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M046.wav|Or not
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M000.wav|Good God
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F000.wav|Do you think it's them
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M001.wav|I wonder
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F001.wav|And nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M002.wav|Well it must be them then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F002.wav|What are you going to do
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M003.wav|We're fine right?  Aren't we?  Whatever happens darling
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F003.wav|Now and always sweet
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M004.wav|I don't care then
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F004.wav|I mean, it was, it's bound to come out sooner or later
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M005.wav|Hello?  Hello?  What
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F005.wav|That sent shivers up my spine
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M006.wav|No, wrong number
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M007.wav|What are we to do if they suddenly walk in on us
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F006.wav|Behave exquisitely
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M008.wav|With the most perfect poise
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F007.wav|Certainly.  And I shall probably do a court courtesy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M009.wav|um- Things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy do they
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F008.wav|What is so horrible is that one cannot stay happy
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M010.wav|Oh, darling.  Don't say that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F009.wav|It's true.  I mean, the whole business it's a very poor joke
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M011.wav|You mean that, that sacred and beautiful thing love
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F010.wav|Yes.  I mean just that
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M012.wav|What does that all mean?  That's what I asked myself on my quest for ultimate truth.  What does it all mean
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F011.wav|Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M013.wav|[LAUGHTER] Oh, darling.  You mustn't be serious, that's just what they want
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F012.wav|Who's they
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M014.wav|All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M015.wav|Laugh at all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings the acid in their damn sweetness and light
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F013.wav|So if I'm to laugh at everything then I must laugh at us too
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M016.wav|Oh, certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun alright
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F014.wav|How long will it last?  This ludicrous overbearing love of ours
/data3/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M017.wav|Who knows
